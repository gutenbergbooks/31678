<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>
Most of us prefer to spend our holiday tours
away from our own country. There is a
feeling of mild adventure when the land
we behold is unknown to us, and when the
language we hear filters into our questioning minds
through an interpreter's suavity and chatter. And
if we go to Switzerland we may earn even a
reputation for intrepid pluck among the friends
who listen to us on our return home, while the
unlucky guides, who found for our trembling feet
a pathway around each danger, will amuse their
families during the winter with little tales at our
expense, told with rough satire and with short,
gruff peals of laughter resembling the noise of a
crackling ice-sheet when it begins to slip downhill.
</p>

<p>
No doubt, heroism on the hillside has a vast
attraction to brave, fearless hearts like our own;
but we should find, here in our own country, quite
as much adventure as is good for us, and quite as
much novelty also, if only we could bring ourselves
to believe that knowledge of native scenes and
traditions does not come to us in baptism or by
virtue of our birth as British folk. If you ask a
friend whether he knows the Border Country, he
will probably answer yes, and then go on to say
that he when a lad at school was a great reader
of Scott, and thank heaven! his memory is a good
one. Push the matter further, ask whether he has
verified the truth of Scott's descriptions by a visit
to the places described, and you will probably
hear that your friend would rather dream of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>North Pole or be bitten fiercely by the swarms of
lively insects treasured throughout Brittany in
every cottage and hotel.
</p>

<p>
All this being somewhat commonplace, you may
wish to get closer to this subject, and your friend
at last, driven to bay, comes to the real point that
pricks and distresses him. "You see," he will
say, "a holiday tour at home is such a dickens of a
gamble. You can't say how much it will cost.
The only thing at all certain about it is that the
cost will be more than you can afford. Wherever
you go you become a goose to be plucked."
</p>

<p>
Let us rebel against this iniquity! It is not
a question of cheating, it is a trait of the national
character. In Great Britain, as among the Americans,
the gift of long sight in business has become
very common, and few persons think it worth their
while to see the practical good things within easy
reach of the blessed short sight of common sense.
Our chief aim is not to keep a market open and
steady, but to glut it with over-production or to
block it with excessive prices. "Here is a holiday-tripper,
so let us make him pay!" That seems to
be the unconquerable maxim at all seaside resorts
and in every place where tired workers seek rest
and health. I have known a week's holiday in
the New Forest to cost as much as a tour of three
weeks in the beautiful and bracing Ardennes.
The Belgian is content to draw his customers back
to him, while the Englishman grasps all he can get
and sends us away discontented.
</p>

<p>
It is true that the railway companies are doing
all in their power to make holidays at home welcome
and inexpensive. Their enterprise in this respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>has no limits. But we cannot live on cheap railway
tickets alone, whether single or return. Something
should be done&mdash;and the newspapers could help&mdash;to
establish in all attractive districts a reasonable
tariff for board and lodging. It is only thus that
Great Britain will be made popular during the
holiday season, and that the great stream of gold&mdash;the
holiday-making Pactolus&mdash;will be drawn
from the Continent to nourish our own country
sides and rural folk.
</p>

<p>
It seems to be certain that, during the reign
of the old stage coach, life in rustic England was
cheaper than it is to-day. At any rate we must
account in some way or other for the immense
number of county histories and illustrated topographical
books which teemed from the press from
the middle of the eighteenth century to the time
of J. M. W. Turner. To study these works is to
be sure that our forefathers took the greatest
delight in their own country, and that huge sums
of money were spent in procuring fine sketches and
adequate engravings. Side by side with these
books on British topography were volumes on
foreign travel, like those by William Alexander,
who in 1792 accompanied Lord Macartney's embassy
to China, where he made many exquisite
sketches, brimful of humour and playful observation.
John Webber, R.A., in 1776, accompanied
Captain Cook on his third and last voyage, and
made a drawing of Cook's death, which Byrne and
Bartolozzi engraved. Two other Royal Academicians,
Thomas and William Daniell, made India
their sketching-ground, and in their great work on
"Oriental Scenery," published in 1808, they devoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>six volumes to a subject as fascinating as it was
unhackneyed. Many other artists, too, travelled
and made sketches for books, ranging from Girtin's
Paris Views to Turner's "Rivers of France," and
from Sir David Wilkie's Eastern sketches, reproduced
in lithography by Nash, to the familiar work of
Prout, Harding, J. F. Lewis, R.A., and Louis Haghe.
</p>

<p>
But these books on foreign travel, admirable
as they were, did not eclipse the many volumes on
British scenery and landscape antiquities. All
the ablest men among the earlier water-colour
painters&mdash;Hearne, Malton, Dayes, Girtin, Turner,
Francia, Havell, De Wint, David Cox, Cotman&mdash;made
topographical sketches for illustrations, and
lucky is he who "finds" their earliest efforts.
To-day, happily, there are signs of renewed life in
the old taste for picture books on the beauty and
romance of our own country. It is a taste that
invigorates, storing the mind with tonic memories
and filling the eyes with beautiful scenes and
colours; and we may be sure that it needs for its
gratification books which are easy to carry and to
read. The great folio of other days, as heavy
almost as a country squire, is rightly treasured in
the British Museum, like the remains of the Neolithic
Man discovered in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
The subject of the present book&mdash;the Border
Country&mdash;should set us thinking, not of one holiday,
but of many; and he who has once tasted the
Border's keen rich air will long to return both to it
and to the traditions that dwell among the vast landscapes
and in the ruined castles. The distinguished
connoisseur and painter whose sketches are here
reproduced, has gone back to the Border Country a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>dozen times and more, always to find there a renewal
of his first pleasure and a host of fresh subjects,
that form a delightful connecting-link between each
to-day and the armoured epochs of the long ago.
</p>

<p>
And if the Border Country, with its enchanted
places and memories, delights a landscape-painter,
it is equally attractive to students of architecture,
to lovers of folk-lore and literary history, to writers
of romance in search of traditions and local colour,
and to those of us also who indulge a passion for
collecting either as botanists or as geologists.
The rivers and streams have a rare fascination,
and anglers, having made their choice, can come
by all the sport which they desire. As to the hills,
they have a certain modesty of height deceptive
to the unwary, for although they have not won for
themselves a reputation for fatalities to be described
as Alpine, they are yet so dangerous when a mist
gathers about them and thickens, that a climber
may lose his life there quite comfortably, and
without enjoying more than the customary amount
of rashness or inexperience. Briefly, men may
find in the Border Country nearly all their hobbies,
and nearly all their professional studies.
</p>

<p>
In this book the historical notes are written
by one who lives by the Tweed, and whose name
is associated with Border subjects. Mr. Crockett's
work is filled with the Past, while the outdoor
sketches by Mr. Orrock are at once so faithful
topographically, and so much in sympathy with the
classic traditions of English Water-Colour, that
they show us what the Border Country is to-day,
when seen through the medium of a painter's
observation and knowledge.

<h2><a name="I_INTRODUCTION" id="I_INTRODUCTION"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>From Berwick to the Solway as the crow flies
is little more than seventy miles. Between
these two points lies the line that divides
England from Scotland. But to follow this line
literally along its every little in and out means
a distance of no fewer than forty good miles more.
Stretching diagonally across the country&mdash;north-east
or south-west&mdash;we have the river Tweed as
eastmost boundary for a considerable space&mdash;close
on twenty miles; then comes the lofty barrier of
the Cheviots extending to thirty odd miles, constituting
the middle portion of the Border line; and
finally, the Kershope Burn, with the Liddel and
Esk Waters, and the small stream of the Sark, make
up the westmost division, another twenty miles, at
least. But to follow the Border on foot, by every
bend of Tweedside, and over every nick and nook
of the Cheviots, and the remaining water-marches,
means, as has been indicated, a walk of not less than
one hundred and ten miles. Almost everywhere in
the land portion of the Border line&mdash;the Cheviots
generally&mdash;the boundary is such that one may stand
with one foot in England and the other in Scotland,
and the rather curious fact will be noted, says one
who has made this Border pilgrimage <i>par excellence</i>,
that Scotland nowhere receives a single rivulet
from England, whilst she sends to England tiny
head-streams of the Coquet and Tyne only. The
delimitation is thus a quite natural and scientific
one, coinciding pretty closely to the water-parting
of the two countries. Upon either side of this
line of demarcation stretches the Border Country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
famous in war and verse the whole world over&mdash;Northumberland
and Cumberland to the south-east
on English soil, and to the north-west, Berwickshire,
Roxburghshire, with part of Dumfriesshire, the
distinctively Border counties on the Scottish side.
A wider radius, however, has been given to the
Scottish Border from a very early period. Old
Scots Acts of Parliament, applying to the Border
district, embrace the counties of Peebles and
Selkirk within the term, though these nowhere
touch the frontier line, and portions of Lanarkshire
and the Lothians have been also included. But
on the face of it, these latter lie entirely outside
the true Border limit. A line drawn on the map
from Coquetmouth to "Merrie Carlisle," thence to
the town of Dumfries, and again, almost due north,
to Tweedsmuir (the source of the Tweed) in Peeblesshire,
and to Peebles itself, and from Peebles
eastward by the Moorfoots and Lammermoors to
the German Ocean at St. Abbs, will give us for all
practical purposes what may be regarded as the
Border Country in its widest signification, geographical
and historical.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a narrower sense in which the
phrase, the Border Country, is used&mdash;the literary.
That, however, applies almost entirely to the
Scottish side, for neither of the English Border
counties owns a tithe of the associations in literature
and romance that belong to those beyond the
Tweed. The extraordinary glamour which has
been cast over the Tweed and its tributaries by
the writings of Sir Walter Scott, the Ettrick
Shepherd, John Leyden, and others, has given a
prominence to the Scottish side which is nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
shared by its southern neighbour. But to say so
is no disparagement to the English side. For what
it lacks in literature it makes up in other admirable
characteristics. Both Borders are rich in historical
memories. Their natural features are not dissimilar,
and in commercial prosperity they are much akin.
In union they have long been happily wedded.</p>

<p>The Border Country is a region of streams and
hills which hardly rise to the dignity of rivers and
mountains. Unlike the Clyde, the Tweed has no
broad estuary laden with the commerce of the
world. And the highest summits, Broad Law
(2754 feet) in Scotland, and the great Cheviot
(2676 feet) in England, have nothing in common
with the rugged Highland peaks except their height.
Both, it has been said, are monuments of denudation
only, "lofty because they have suffered less wear than
their neighbours."</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine all this attractive
Border Country as at one period a vast ocean-bed,
over which waves lashed in furious foam, and sea-birds
shrieked and flew amid the war of waters.
Yet geology assures us such was its condition
ages ago. By-and-by, it became a great rolling
plain or table-land, and in age after age&mdash;how
many and how long it were vain to speculate&mdash;there
was carried on that stupendous process by
which those fair green hills and glens have been so
marvellously scooped out, and moulded and rounded
into the objects of beauty that we see about us now.
In the great glacier movements, in the working of
the ice-sheets, and under the influences of frost,
beating rain, and a constant water-flow operating
through a countless series of years, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the scientific explanation of their present benign
and comfortable-looking appearance. The Border
hills are of a purely pastoral type, grass-grown
from base to summit, and usually easy of ascent.
Here and there one meets with a distinctly Highland
picture&mdash;in the deep dark glens down Moffatdale,
for instance, but in the main they exhibit
"the sonsie, good-humoured, buirdly look," for
which Dr. "Rab" Brown expressed the liveliest
predilection. Once at the curiously plateau-like
summit of Broadlaw (out-topped in Southern
Scotland by the Galloway Merrick only) or Hart
Fell (2651 feet), or the Cheviot, the feeling amounts
to a kind of awe even. Scott speaks of the silence
of noonday on the top of Minchmoor, and the acute
sense of human littleness one always feels amidst
the "mountain infinities." "I assure you," he
says, "I have felt really oppressed with a sort of
fearful loneliness when looking around these naked
towering ridges of desolate barrenness." The picture
seen from such a height is both an inspiring
and a humbling one. Beneath, it is a veritable
earth-ocean that we are gazing upon. On all sides
an innumerable series of what look like huge
elephant-backed ranges are seen to be chasing each
other like waves of the sea, as it were, ridge after
ridge, rising, flowing, falling, and passing into the one
beyond it, as far as the eye can reach. Enclosed
between each we know are the rushing hill-burns
and broader streams by which the Border country is
everywhere so much blessed and beautified. At such
a height we are entirely outside the human
touches&mdash;altogether alone with Nature at her
simplest and solemnest. The cry of a startled sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and the summer hum of insects on the hill-top&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That undefined and mingled hum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voice of the desert, never dumb"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are the only indications of life where all trace and
feeling of man and his work have disappeared.
Occasionally we shall meet by chance with the shepherd,
maybe, who has his dwelling far down among
the "hopes"&mdash;the cul-de-sacs of the uplands.
Amongst those hills he lives and moves and has his
being. All sorts of weather-conditions find him at his
work. He never thinks of the loneliness, and the
winter storms have not the terrors for him as for
his predecessors. In some respects his life is an
ideal one, and his class has a goodly record for
intelligence and fine physique. The best specimens,
indeed, of the country's manhood are drawn from
the agricultural labouring classes&mdash;the "herds"
and "hinds" who make up the bulk of the population
in the purely rural districts. For agriculture,
it need scarcely be said, is the staple business of
both Borders. The Tweed industry, to be sure,
affords employment to thousands, but on the
Borders, as elsewhere, the land is the crucial problem.
Within recent years many of the rural
parishes have been woefully depleted, and until
the land question is fairly tackled there seems
small hope for a fresh and brighter chapter in the
domestic history of the Border Country.</p>

<p>A hundred years have transformed the face of
the Border Country in a marked manner. The
development of agriculture, and the growth of the
tree-planting spirit, which began to bestir itself
about the beginning of last century, have given
to the Border its modern picturesqueness and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
look of prosperity. Sir Walter Scott himself may
be said to be the father of arboriculture in the
South of Scotland. In the creation of Abbotsford,
forestry was his main out-of-doors hobby, and the
example set by one who had studied the subject
thoroughly, and who discoursed pleasantly upon
it, was quickly followed by all the neighbouring
lairds and many others besides. Not that the
country was altogether treeless before Scott's
day. Here and there "ancestral oaks" clumped
themselves about the great castles and mansions,
with perhaps some further attempt at embellishment.
But that was rare enough. It needed
a man like Scott to popularize the notion, and to
take the lead in an undertaking fraught, as this
age well sees, with results so beneficent. We do
not forget, of course, that in earlier historic times
practically the whole of the Border Country was
covered with wood. Its inhabitants, whose very
names&mdash;Gadeni and Ottadini&mdash;signified "dwellers
in the wood," were found by the Romans in their
dense forests, and the first settlements were only
possible through clearances of growing timber.
Across the country, from Cadzow, in Renfrewshire,
to the Ettrick, there stretched the vast Wood of
Caledon (whence Caledonia), known at a later
period as the Forest of Ettrick, or simply as the
Forest (<i>e.g.</i>, the "Flowers of the Forest"). There
is no doubt that it was largely a forest in the ordinary
acceptation, and not a mere deer-forest use
of the term. Over and over again we have the
various charters, as to the Abbeys, for instance,
authorising the monks to cut down for building
purposes and fuel oaks "from the forest," both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Selkirk and in Melrose, in Kelso and the Ettrick.
The original religious house of Melrose was entirely
of oak. So were the first churches founded by
Kentigern and Cuthbert, and those even of a later
date. The Forest of Ettrick survived to the time
of the Stuarts, who had here their favourite hunting
expeditions, James V. and Queen Mary especially
being frequent visitors to the Borderland. The
Forest of Megget, or Rodono (a sub-division of that
of Ettrick), yielded on one occasion no fewer than five
hundred head of game, bird and beast of the chase,
and at another time eighteen score of red deer.
In the reign of Mary there was issued a proclamation
limiting and prohibiting the slaughter of deer in
the Forest on account of their growing scarcity.
And by the time of James VI. the hunting possibilities
of the Border were at an end.</p>

<p>More than anything else, the laying down of
the great railway lines and the immense road
improvements of last century have opened up
practically every corner of the Border Country.
There are now no places so utterly inaccessible
as Liddesdale was during Scott's visits. It is
possible to reach the most out-of-the-way parts
with comparative comfort. And with the dawn
of the motor age, still greater hopes and possibilities
appear in store.</p>

<h3><a name="TheMakingOfTheBorder" id="TheMakingOfTheBorder">THE MAKING OF THE BORDER</a></h3>

<p>It is from the Roman historian Tacitus that
the light of history falls for the first time on the
Border Country. It is a mere glimpse, however.
But it is enough to show us the calibre of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
who held its forests and fastnesses at that remote
period. They were the Brigantes, a branch probably
of the Celts, who were the first to reach
Britain, coming from the common home-land of the
Ayrian race somewhere in Central Asia. Their
kingdom, Brigantia, embraced all the country
between the Mersey and Humber and the Links of
Forth. They are spoken of as a strong, courageous
and warlike people, able for many years to keep
the Roman cohorts at bay and to check the northward
progress of the invaders. The Roman Conquest
of Britain, as is well known, was begun by
Julius Caesar as far back as <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 55. It was not,
however, till the time of Julius Agricola (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
78-84) that the Romans obtained a firm footing on
the island. Agricola's generalship was more than a
match for the sturdy Brigantes. He carried the
Roman eagles to the Forth and Clyde, fixing his
main line of defence and his northmost frontier on
the isthmus between these two firths. But about
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 120, when the Emperor Hadrian visited Britain,
his chief work was the delimitation of the Roman
territory by the great stone wall still bearing his
name, stretching from the Tyne to the Solway,
a distance of 73&frac12; miles. Twenty years later,
however, Lollius Urbicus, the Emperor's lieutenant
in Britain, appears to have revived and restored
Agricola's boundary, so that what we now know
as the Border Country, for more than three hundred
years (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 78-410), formed a part of the mightiest
empire of the ancient world. Hadrian's rampart,
the great camps at Cappuck, near Jedburgh, at
Lyne in Peeblesshire, and Newstead at the base of
the Eildons&mdash;the undoubted Roman Trimontium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&mdash;with
the roads known as Watling Street and the
Wheel Causeway are the chief memorials of a
singularly historic Occupation. Following the withdrawal
of the Roman legions the district became the
arena of constant warfare between Picts and Scots
and Britons, until the sixth century, when it appears
again in history as a kingdom of the Saxon Heptarchy
under the name of Bernicia, and occupied
by a colony of Angles and Saxons from the Low
Countries of the Continent, the progenitors of the
English-speaking race. Ida the Good governed
Bernicia, having for his capital the proud rock-fortress
of Bibbanburgh (so named from his queen
Bibba), the modern Bamborough. In the following
century Bernicia was combined with Deira, its
southern neighbour (corresponding to Yorkshire)
to form the powerful kingdom of Northumbria,
extending, as Brigantia had done, from the Humber
to the Forth. For the next three or four hundred
years the story of the Border was little more than
a wild record of lawlessness and bloodshed. It
had grown to be a kind of happy hunting-ground
for every hostile tribe within fighting distance, and
for some even who were drawn from long distances,
like the Danes, the latest of the invading hordes.
But there is nothing of importance to narrate
at this period. From a monarchy, Northumbria
fell to the level of an Earldom in 954, and in 1018,
the Scots, consolidated to some extent under Malcolm
II., crushed the Angles of Northumbria in a great
victory at Carham-on-Tweed (near Coldstream),
of which the result was the cession to Scotland of
the district known as Lothian&mdash;the land lying
between the Tweed and Forth. Thus at the dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the 11th century we have the Tweed constituting
the virtual boundary between the two countries.
Cumberland, to be sure, was for a time Scots territory,
but this the intrepid Rufus wrested back in
1092. So that by the close of that century the Border
line appears to have taken the quite natural
course of delimitation&mdash;the Tweed, the Cheviots,
and the Solway, though it was not till as late as
1222 that a commission of both countries was
appointed to adjust the final demarcation.</p>

<h3><a name="TheChristianizingOfTheBorder" id="TheChristianizingOfTheBorder">THE CHRISTIANIZING OF THE BORDER</a></h3>

<p>It would be interesting to know precisely
when and how the light of the Christian faith
first penetrated the Border Country, but neither
the time nor the manner can be ascertained with
certainty. Indeed, it is impossible to say who
were the real pioneers of the Gospel within the
realm itself. The probability is that in the first
instance it was the beneficent work of the Romans
in whose legions were to be found many sincere
Christians, many faithful soldiers of the Cross.
From the "saints of Cæsar's household"&mdash;not a
mere picturesque dream&mdash;mayhap the Gospel found
its way to the coasts of Britain, the greatest boon
that could be conferred on a nation. An unvarying
Peeblesshire tradition, for example, avers that
among the first to witness for Christ and His truth
by the banks of the Tweed and its tributaries were
Roman soldiers from the great military station at
Hall Lyne, and out of whose quiet fellowship-meetings
in the recesses of the Manor, sprang the church
of that valley, one of the oldest in the county,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and dedicated to Saint Gordian, either the Emperor
of that name, or what is more likely, "Gordian
the well-beloved," Deputy of Gaul, who suffered
martyrdom about the year 362. Be that as it
may, it is at any rate certain that long before
the departure of the Romans from Britain, Christianity
had made considerable headway in the
island. St. Ninian's is the earliest definite name
which has come down to us, about the end of the
4th and beginning of the 5th century. His labours
were confined chiefly to the Galloway side of the
Border, where the remains of his Candida Casa, or
White House, may still be seen at Whithorn on
the shores of Wigtown Bay. It is more than
possible that some of Ninian's missionaries, or a
rumour of his work and teaching at all events, had
passed beyond the Solway to the Clyde and Tweed
watersheds. But, on the other hand, the difficulties
following the departure of the Romans in the constant
incursions from the Continent and the terrible
internecine struggles of the time, would be sufficient
to extinguish whatever light had faintly begun to
shine. And it is not until well on in the 6th century
that the darkness begins to grow less dense. Such
names as Augustine, Paulinus, Columba, Kentigern
or Mungo, Aidan and Cuthbert, come upon the scene,
with each of whom seems to rest, as it were, the hope
of the Church of Christ in Britain. In the year
597 Augustine arrived in Kent with forty monks
in his train. The incident, apocryphal perhaps, which
led to his mission, is at least interesting. The
story has been told again and again, but it will
bear repeating. Ælla, King of Deira, had defeated
his northern neighbour, and with a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
spoil hastened to fill the Roman slave-market.
Gregory the Great, in the days that preceded his pontificate,
passed one day through the market-place when
it was crowded with people, all attracted by the
arrival of fresh cargoes of merchandise; and he saw
three boys set for sale. They were white-complexioned,
fair and light, and with noble heads of hair. Filled
with compassion, he enquired of the dealer from
what part of the world they had come, and was told
"from Britain, where all the inhabitants have the
same fair complexion." He next asked whether the
people of this strange land were Christians or pagans,
and hearing that they were pagans he heaved a
deep sigh, and remarked it was sad to think that
beings so bright and fair should be in the power
of the Prince of Darkness. He next enquired the
name of their nation. "Angles," was the reply.
"'Tis well," he answered, playing on the word,
"rightly are they called <i>Angles</i>, for their faces are
the faces of angels, and they ought to be fellow-heirs
with the angels of heaven." "And what is the
name," he proceeded, "of the province from which
they have been brought?" "From Deira," was
the answer. Catching its name, he rejoined,
"Rightly are they named <i>Deirans</i>. Plucked from
<i>ire</i>, and called to the mercy of Christ." "And
who," he asked once more, "is the King of this
province?" "Ælla," was the reply. The word
recalled the Hebrew expression of praise, and he
answered, "Allelujah! the praise of God shall be
chanted in that clime!" And as Green so beautifully
puts it in his "Making of England," "he
passed on, musing how the angel faces should be
brought to sing it." And brought to sing it they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were when the evangelist Paulinus found his way
in the best sense, to the heart of heathen Northumbria.
Paulinus, whom men long remembered,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of shoulders curved, and stature tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black hair, and vivid eye, and meagre cheek."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>had come from Rome with Bishop Justus in 601,
and laboured with Augustine in the evangelization
of Kent. When Ethelburga, daughter of Ethelbert
of Kent, Augustine's convert, became wedded
to Edwin, the still idolatrous King of Northumbria,
Paulinus accompanied her as chaplain, and at the
same time as missionary among the rude Northumbrians.
The field of his labours was a wide one.
For a long time he made no progress until Edwin
himself, moved by his escape from assassination
at the hands of the King of Wessex, and by his
victory over Wessex, and under the gentle constraint
of Paulinus, resolved that both he and his nobles
should be baptized, and this resolution was carried
into effect at York, in a hastily-built chapel (the
precursor of the Minster), on Easter Eve, 627.</p>

<p>The conversion of Edwin was followed by a
great social revolution. Having convoked the
National Assembly, he unfolded the reasons for his
change of faith. Everywhere he was applauded.
Crowds of the nobility, chiefs of petty states, and
the great mass of the people followed the example
of their King. The worship of the ancient gods was
solemnly renounced, and even Coifi, the high priest,
was the first to give the signal for destruction by
hurling his lance at an idol in the pagan temple.
Paulinus was now one of the most popular figures
in Northumbria. Wherever he preached, crowds
gathered to hear him and to be received, like their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Overlord, into the Christian communion. Many
spots in Northumberland are identified with the
name of this early and ardent Apostle of the North.
Pallinsburn, overlooking Flodden Field, is, of course,
Paulinus's Burn, where large numbers were baptized.
In one of his missionary journeys we are
told (Bede) how he was occupied for six and thirty
consecutive days from early morn until nightfall, in
teaching the people and in "washing them with
the water of absolution" in the river Glen, which
flowed by the royal "vill" of Yeavering (anciently
Ad-gebrin) in Glendale. At the Lady's Well near
Holystone, in the vale of the Coquet, about three
thousand converts were welcomed into the Church
of Christ. A graceful Runic cross erected on the
spot bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
+<span class="smcap">In this Place<br />
Pavlinvs the Bishop<br />
Baptized<br />
Three Thousand Northvmbrians.<br />
Easter, DCXXVII.</span>+<br />
</p>

<p>But after six years of incessant labours, the death
of Edwin in battle with Penda, King of the Mercians,
and Cadwallon of North Wales, put a sudden stop
to his work. He did not wait for the honour of
martyrdom, but went back with the widowed queen
to Kent, where he became Bishop of Rochester, and
she the Abbess of Lyminge. Paulinus died in 644,
and was buried in the chapter-house at Rochester.</p>

</div>

<p>But it is ever the darkest hour that precedes
the dawn. It was impossible that England should
lose her faith and fall back under the rule of a mere
heathen conqueror. After the "thoughtful Edwin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mightiest of all the kings of the isle of Britain," as
he has been called (he was, by the way, the founder of
Edinburgh), there arose another champion of
the new light in the person of Oswald, Edwin's
nephew. Oswald's history connects him with Columba
the Irishman, and "Apostle of Scotland,"
to whose splendid work the nation owed its first
real religious advance. About 563, when in his
forty-second year, and accompanied by twelve
companions, Columba found a resting-place on the
little island of Hy or Iona, off the west coast of
Scotland, whence he set himself to the great
work of his life&mdash;the conversion of the Pictish tribes
beyond the Grampians. At Iona Oswald had
sheltered during the home troubles, and many
valuable lessons he must have learned for the
strenuous life that lay in front of him. Called
to lead his countrymen against their oppressors,
Oswald literally fought his way to the throne. On
a rising ground, a few miles from Hexham, near
the Roman Wall, he gathered in 634 a small force,
which pledged itself to become Christian if it
conquered in the engagement. Causing a cross of
wood to be hastily made, and digging a hole for it
in the earth, he supported it with his own hands
while his men hedged up the soil around it. Then,
like Bruce at Bannockburn years afterwards, he
bade his soldiers kneel with him and entreat the
true and living God to defend their cause, which he
knew to be just, from the fierce and boastful foe.
This done they joined battle, and attacked Cadwallon's
far superior forces. The charge was
irresistible. The Welsh army fled down the slope
towards the Deniseburn,&mdash;a brook near Dilston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
which has been identified with the Rowley Burn,&mdash;and
Cadwallon himself, the hero of fourteen battles
and sixty skirmishes, was caught and slain. This
was the battle of Hefenfelt, or Heaven's Field, as
after-times called it. Not only was the last hero
of the old British races utterly routed, but Oswald,
King of once more reunited Bernicia and Deira,
proved himself to the Christian cause all that
Edwin had been, and more, a prince in the prime
of life, and fitted by his many good qualities to
attract a general enthusiasm of admiration, reverence,
and love. Resolved to restore the national
Christianity, and to realize the ambitions of his
exile life, he turned naturally to Iona and to the
teachers of his youth for missionaries who would
accomplish the holy task. At his request, Aidan,
one of the fittest of the Columban band, was sent to
carry on the work of evangelization in Northumbria,
which happy event may be reckoned as the first
permanent planting of the Gospel in the Eastern
Border. The light which he kindled was never
afterwards quenched. And as Columba had chosen
Iona, so for Aidan there was one spot to which his
heart went out above all others. This was the
island-peninsula of Lindisfarne, off the Northumbrian
coast, so called from the little river Lindis,
which here enters the sea, and the Celtic <i>fahren</i>,
"a recess." Bede has a fine passage which is worth
quoting:&mdash;"On the arrival of the Bishop (Aidan)
King Oswald appointed him his episcopal see in
the isle of Lindisfarne, as he desired. Which
place as the tide flows and ebbs twice a day, is
enclosed by the waves of the sea like an island;
and again, twice in the day, when the shore is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
dry, becomes contiguous to the land. The King
also humbly and willingly in all cases giving ear
to his admonitions, industriously applied himself
to build and extend the church of Christ in his
kingdom; wherein, when the Bishop, who was not
skilful in the English tongue, preached the gospel,
it was most delightful to see the King himself
interpreting the Word of God to his commanders
and ministers, for he had perfectly learned the
language of the Scots during his long banishment.
From that time many of the Scots came daily into
Britain, and with great devotion preached the
word to those provinces of the English over which
King Oswald reigned, and those among them that
had received priest's orders, administered to them
the grace of baptism. Churches were built in
several places; the people joyfully flocked together
to hear the Word; money and lands were given
of the King's bounty to build monasteries; the
English, great and small, were, by their Scottish
masters, instructed in the rules and observance
of regular discipline; for most of them that came
to preach were monks." (Eccl. Hist. Bk. iii., c. 2).
Than Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, as it came to
be called, there is no more sacred spot in Northumbria&mdash;in
England even. Its history is coeval
with that of the nation, and it was from that hallowed
centre of Christian activity that the gospelizing of
both sides of the Border was planned and prayed over
many an anxious hour and day. Aidan's missionaries
went forth planting churches in various places.
One of the best known of these settlements was
Old Melrose, the original shrine by the beautiful
bend of the Tweed, a mile or two down the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
from the second and more celebrated Melrose.
Here Eata, "a man much revered and meek;"
and Boisil, who gave his name to the neighbouring
St. Boswells; and Cuthbert, the most illustrious
of them all, served God with gladness. Of the
latter, certainly the most conspicuous Borderer
of his day, something more must be said. Three
kingdoms claim his birthplace. The Irish Life of
the Saint alleges him to be sprung of her own blood
royal; he is affirmed also to have come of noble
Northumbrian descent; whilst the Scottish tradition
makes him the child of humble parents, born
and reared in Lauderdale, one of the sweetest
valleys of the Border. It is a fact, at any rate,
that when the light of record first falls upon him
the youthful Cuthbert is seen as a shepherd lad by
the Leader; he is religiously inclined, and whilst his
comrades sleep, he spends whole nights in prayer and
meditation. One day he hears voices from out the
unseen calling to him. Another night it is a vision
of angels that he fancies he beholds bearing the
soul of the sainted Aidan to the skies. Such was
Cuthbert, a kind of mystic, a dreamer of strange
dreams, destined apostle and Bishop, and next to
Augustine himself the most illustrious figure in the
annals of English monasticism. The church of
Channelkirk (anciently Childeschirche) dedicated to
the Saint, probably indicates his birth-spot. The
Leader valley is full of legends of his boyhood, the
whole west of Berwickshire, indeed, being haunted
ground for Cuthbert's sake. Other great names
in the history of early Border Christianity are those
of Benedict Biscop, the founder of the monasteries
of Jarrow and Monk Wearmouth; Wilfrid, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
founder of Hexham; and the Venerable Bede&mdash;the
"father of English learning"&mdash;whose "Church
History of the English People" is the greatest of
the forty-five works that bear his name.</p>

<p>By far the most flourishing epoch in the religious
development of the Border was the founding of
the great Abbeys under David I.&mdash;"St. David"&mdash;as
he is often called, though he was never canonized.
Whilst still a Prince, he founded a monastery at
Selkirk, and after his accession to the throne, there
arose the four stately fanes of Kelso (1128), Melrose
(1146), Jedburgh (1147), and Dryburgh (1150)&mdash;those
rich and peaceful homes of art and intellectual
culture whose ruins now strike us with marvel and
regret. There is probably no other country district
equally small in area that can boast a group of ruins
at once so grand and interesting as those that lie
within a few miles of each other along the banks
of the Tweed and Jed. Founded almost contemporaneously,
they were destroyed about the
same time, by the same ruthless hands. The story
of each is the story of all&mdash;burned and rebuilt,
then spoiled and restored again, time after time,
until finally at the dismal Hertford Invasion, in
1545, they all received their death-stroke. Other
religious centres on the Scottish side were Coldingham
in Berwickshire, founded in 1098 by King
Edgar, son of Canmore and St. Margaret; Dundrennan,
in Kirkcudbrightshire, founded in 1142 by
Fergus, Lord of Galloway; and Sweetheart or
New Abbey, founded in 1275 by Devorgoil, great-great-granddaughter
of David the First. On the
English side, the Church had a less vigorous growth,
having no such munificent patron as King David,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but there, too, it could boast of Carlisle Cathedral,
the Abbey of Alnwick, the Priories of Lanercost, and
Hexham, and the still more renowned and classic
Lindisfarne. The history of the latter began, as
we saw, with the year 635, when Saint Aidan
accepted the invitation of King Oswald to teach
the new faith to the Northumbrians. Aidan's
church, built of wood, and thatched with the coarse
bents of the links, could not long withstand the
storms or the brands of the wild sea-rovers. And
of the stone sanctuary reared under the rule of
succeeding bishops no portion of the present ruin
can be considered as forming a part. Sir Walter
Scott has thrown the spell of his genius around the
picturesque ruins, but the tragical story of Constance
of Beverley has no foundation in fact.</p>

<h3><a name="BorderWarfare" id="BorderWarfare">BORDER WARFARE</a></h3>

<p>Of Border warfare it were impossible to treat
within the limits of a library. In no part
of the kingdom was the fighting and raiding
spirit more rampant. The Border clans were
constantly at war with one another, the slightest
excuse provoking an attack, and not unfrequently
was there no <i>raison d'être</i> whatever for the accompanying
ruin and desolation. It ran apparently
in the blood of those old Borderers to live on unfriendly
terms with their neighbours, and to seize
every possible opportunity against them. The
record of the raids does not lean more to one side
than another for aggressiveness, though generally
the Scot has been credited for this quality. But
as a matter of fact both sides were equally at fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and equally determined. And the onslaughts were
often of the most savage and persistent kind, and
were almost entirely unchecked by the legal restraints
which were set in force. The division of
the district into East, West and Middle Marches,
with a sort of vice-regal Warden appointed over
each, was not always conducive to peace and good
feeling. At certain times, a day of truce was held
when the Wardens of both sides met and settled
any questions that might be in dispute between
their followers, but occasionally the decision was
anything but harmonious&mdash;as in the case of the
Reidswire, for instance. In the "Debateable or
Threep Lands," which lay partly in England and
partly in Scotland, between the Esk and the Sark,
no end of worry and difficulty was experienced.
"Its chief families were the Armstrongs and Grahams,
both clans being noted as desperate thieves
and freebooters. They had frequently to be dealt
with by force of arms till in the 17th century, the
Grahams were transported to Ireland, and forbidden
to return upon pain of death. Other districts of
the Borders from time to time called forth hostile
visitations from the Scottish kings or their commissioners,
when great numbers of the robbers
were frequently seized and hanged. So late as
1606, the Earl of Dunbar executed as many as 140
of them. The Union of the Crowns removed some
obvious grounds of contention between the English
and Scottish people, and after the middle of the
17th century the Borders gradually subsided into
a more peaceful condition."</p>

<p>It was doubtless due to the exigencies occasioned
by those frequently recurring wars and raids from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the 13th to the 16th century that the whole country
on both sides of the frontier became so thickly
studded with castles and peel-towers, the numerous
ruins of which still form a distinctive feature in
Border scenery, although from times much earlier
the castles and strongholds were characteristic
elements in the old Scottish landscape. Alexander
Hume, of Polwarth, the poet-preacher of Logie,
near Stirling, in his fine description of a "Summer's
Day," thus refers to them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The rayons of the sunne we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diminish in their strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shade of everie tower and tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extended is in length.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great is the calm for everie quhair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind is settlin' downe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reik thrawes right up in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From everie tower and towne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Generally these towers were planted on heights
overlooking the river-valleys, and, as a rule, within
sight of one another, in order that the signals of
invasion or alarm&mdash;flashed by means of the bale
fire&mdash;might be the more rapidly spread from point
to point. Very few of them are now entire&mdash;the
best-preserved on the Scottish side being, perhaps,
Barns, at the entrance to the Manor valley; Bemersyde,
still inhabited; and Oakwood on the Ettrick,
incorporated in the present farm buildings; and
on the English side, Corbridge and Doddington
and Whittingham. From a return made in 1460
we find that Northumberland alone possessed
37 castles and 78 towers, and the Scottish side was
equally well strengthened and defended. Amongst
the larger and more important fortresses on the
English side were the Castles of Alnwick, Bothal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Carlisle, Cockermouth, Coupland, Dilston, Elsdon,
Etal, Ford, Naworth, Norham, Prudhoe, Wark,
Warkworth; and on the Scottish side, Berwick,
Branxholme, Caerlaverock (the true Ellangowan
of "Guy Mannering"), Cessford, Ferniherst,
Hermitage, Hume, Jedburgh, Neidpath, Peebles,
Roxburgh, Threave, Traquair, besides, as has been
said, hundreds of peel and bastle-houses scattered
all over the country.</p>

<p>It would be a quite impossible task to chronicle
the incessant clan-raids of the Border, and to
narrate all the invasions that took place on either
side would be to repeat in great measure the general
history of England and Scotland. But at least
two authentic reports, covering little more than
a year, may be quoted as showing the extraordinary
havoc and destruction caused by the latter. "In
1544 Sir Ralph Evers and Sir Brian Latoun, with
an English army, invaded the Scottish Border, and
between July and November they destroyed 192
towns, towers, barmkyns, parish churches, etc.;
slew 403 Scots and took 816 prisoners; carried
off 10,386 head of cattle, 12,492 sheep, 1296 horses,
200 goats, and 850 bolls of corn, besides an untold
quantity of inside gear and plenishing. In one
village alone&mdash;that of Lessudden (now St. Boswells)&mdash;Sir
Ralph Evers writes that he burned 16 strong
bastle-houses. Again in September of the following
year, the Earl of Hertford a second time invaded
the country, and between the 8th and the 23rd of
that month, he razed and cast down the abbeys of
Jedburgh, Kelso, Dryburgh, and Melrose, and
burned the town of Kelso. At the same time he
destroyed about 30 towns, towers and villages on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the Tweed, 36 on the Teviot, 12 on Rulewater, 13
on the Jed, 45 on the Kale, 19 on the Bowmont, 109
in the parishes of Eccles and Duns in Berwickshire,
with 20 other towns and villages in the same
county. The places destroyed are all named in
the report to the English king, along with a classified
list of that terrible sixteen days' destruction, embracing
7 monasteries and friars' houses, 16 castles,
towers and peels, 5 market-towns, the immense
number of 243 villages, with 13 mills, and 3 hospitals."</p>

<p>It cannot be forgotten that upon Border soil
were fought at least six of the great historical battles
of the nation, <i>viz.</i>, Halidon Hill (1333); Otterburn
(1388); Homildon Hill (1402); Flodden (1513);
Solway Moss (1542); and Ancrum Moor (1544).
Of mere internal contests there are the fight at
Arkinholm (Langholm, 1455), between Scotsmen,
where James II. broke the power of the Douglases;
the battle of Hedgeley Moor (1464), and of Hexham
(1464) between the English adherents of Lancaster
and York, when the Lancastrians were defeated;
the affair of Melrose (Skirmish Hill, 1526) between
Borderers under the Earl of Angus and Buccleuch;
and Philiphaugh (1645) when Leslie drove Montrose
from the field. Of what were purely faction fights
and deeds of daring such as the Raid of the Reidswire
(1575), and the rescue of Kinmont Willie
(1596), the ancient ballads will keep their memory
green for many a year to come.</p>

</div>

<p>Two great incidents of Border warfare stand
out before all others&mdash;Otterburn and Flodden.
Old Froissart has told the story of Otterburn.
The Scottish barons, tired of the fickleness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
inactivity of their king, determined to invade
England, met at Aberdeen, and arranged the preliminaries
for a great gathering at Southdean,
beyond Jedburgh. On the day appointed the best
blood in Scotland was assembled. "There had
not been for sixty years so numerous an assembly&mdash;they
amounted to twelve hundred spears and forty
thousand other men and archers." The Earl of
Douglas, the Earl of March and Dunbar, and the
Earl of Moray, with three hundred picked lancers
and two thousand infantry, burst into Northumberland,
rode south as far as Durham, and laid waste
the country. In one of their encounters before
Newcastle-on-Tyne the Earl of Douglas had a hand-to-hand
combat with Sir Henry Percy&mdash;- Hotspur,&mdash;who
was overthrown, Douglas seizing his pennon&mdash;the
silken streamer bearing his insignia, which
was fastened near the head of his lance. In triumph
he exclaimed: "I will carry this token of your
prowess with me into Scotland, and place it on the
tower of my castle at Dalkeith, that it may be seen
from afar." "By God, Earl of Douglas," replied
Hotspur, "you shall not even bear it out of Northumberland;
be assured you shall never have this
pennon to boast of." "You must come then,"
answered Douglas, "this night and seek for it. I
will fix your pennon before my tent, and shall see
if you will venture to take it away." On the
following evening the Scottish army "lighted high
on Otterburn," in Redesdale, and there Sir Henry
and Ralph Percy, with six hundred spears of knights
and squires and upwards of eight thousand infantry,
fell upon the Scots, who were but three hundred
lances, and two thousand others. The fight that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
followed was one of the most spirited in history,
and ended in the death of Douglas, the capture of
Hotspur, the serious wounding of his brother, and
the killing or capture of one thousand and forty
Englishmen on the field, the capture of eight
hundred and forty others in the pursuit, and the
wounding of a thousand more. The Scots lost only
one hundred slain and two hundred captured.
"It was," says Froissart, "the hardest and most
obstinate battle ever fought." The tragic incidents
of this encounter have been kept alive not historically
but poetically. It is the immortality of song which
preserves the memory of Otterburn. No contest
was more emphatically the "ballad-singer's joy."
Two ballads, the one Scots, the other English, give
their respective versions of the event with those
natural discrepancies between the two, which
may easily be accounted for on patriotic grounds.
That given in Scott's "Minstrelsy" is unquestionably
the finer, and contains the lines so often quoted
by Scott himself, and at no occasion more pathetically
than during his visit&mdash;pretty near the end&mdash;to
the old Douglas shrines in Lanarkshire, the
locality of "Castle Dangerous":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My wound is deep. I fain would sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thou the vanguard of the three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hide me by the braken bush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grows on yonder lilye lea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O bury me by the braken bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the blooming brier;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let never living mortal ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ere a kindly Scot lies here."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The story of Flodden is the darkest, perhaps, on
the page of Scottish history, and like Otterburn, has
been written in strains grand and majestic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
certainly the most heart-moving in the whole
realm of northern minstrelsy. There Scotland lost
her King, the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, James's
natural son, two abbots, twelve earls, seventeen
lords, four hundred knights, and fifteen thousand
others, all sacrificed to the fighting pride of James IV.
of Scotland. Pierced by several strong arrows, the
left hand hacked clean from the arm, the neck laid
open in the middle, James's body was carried
mournfully to Berwick. He had died a hero's
death, albeit a foolish one. His last words have
lived in the lines of the rhymer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fight on, my men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Fortune she may turn the scale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for my wounds be not dismayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever let your courage fail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus dying did he brave appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till shades of death did close his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till then he did his soldiers cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise their courage to the skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The era of Blood and Iron on the Borders has passed
long since. Peace and prosperity prevail on both
sides of the Tweed. Old animosities are seldom
spoken of, and hardly ever remembered. A cordial
amity and good-will and co-operation evidence the
strength of the cementing element which no loyal
heart, either north or south, can ever desire to see
broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II_THE_ENGLISH_BORDER" id="II_THE_ENGLISH_BORDER"></a>II. THE ENGLISH BORDER</h2>

<h3>NORTHUMBERLAND</h3>

<p>A line drawn from Berwick to Carlisle, and
across England to the Coquet, thence north
again, coast-wise, to the old Tweedside
borough will give us, for all practical purposes, the
English Border Country. Only a part of the Roman
Wall, as far as Crag Loch and Borcovicus (Housesteads),
will come within the present purview, which
excludes Newcastle itself and the "coaly Tyne."
We are to deal with rural Northumberland rather,
and with a little corner of Cumberland, the immediate
and true Border. Even at this time of day
much of the English Border is still a kind of <i>terra
incognita</i> to the tourist and holiday-maker. For
travelling facilities have not been of the best
hitherto. But it is a new order of things now, and
even the most outlying spots can be reached with
a wonderful degree of comfort impossible not so
very long ago. Bewcastle, for instance, and the
once wild and trackless "Debateable Land"
between Canonbie and the Solway, have come
within comparatively easy distance of railroad and
coaching centres. The crossing of the Solway
Moss by the Caledonian Route, and the opening
out of the line from Alnwick to Wooler and Cornhill,
together with the numerous driving tours that
are in daily operation during the summer at least,
have become the <i>open sesame</i> to a district practically
shut up even less than a half century since. It is
now possible to breakfast in Carlisle, or Newcastle,
or much further south for that matter (or north),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and within an hour or two to be revelling in the
most delightful rusticities at the foot of the Cheviots,
or in the very heart of them. The remotest localities
are rendered accessible even for a single day's
outing, and a holiday on the English Border is not
likely to be a disappointing one. There is something
to suit every taste. If one is archaeologically
inclined, for instance, Northumberland has one of
the finest collections of military antiquities in the
kingdom, from the rude circular camps and entrenchments
of the primitive inhabitants to the
great castles and peel-towers of mediæval times.
The Romans have left a mighty monument of their
power&mdash;none more significant&mdash;in the huge barrier
thrown across the lower half of the county, and in
the stations and roads connected with it. In
some respects the Roman Wall may be accounted
Northumberland's principal attraction, and a pilgrimage
between Tyne and Solway must always
repay itself. If one is artistically inclined, there
are beauty-spots for all canvases&mdash;as befits
the birthplace of such masters as Bewick and
Foster. And as an angler's paradise the Cheviot
uplands have long been popular. The historical
memories of the English Border are outstanding.
For centuries this little fringe of country was a
continuous warring-ground for the two nations that
are now happily one. Upon its soil were fought
some of the bloodiest, and it must be added, some of
the most fool-hardy and unjustifiable fights on
record. In its religious story it has much to boast
of. By its missionaries and by its sword it won
England from heathendom to the Christian Church.
The development of the monastic system in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Northumbria did more than anything else to civilise
and colonise the entire realm, Scotland included.
"Its monasteries," as Green says, "were the seat of
whatever intellectual life the country possessed,
and above all, it had been the first to gather together
into a loose political unity the various tribes of the
English people, and by standing at their head for
nearly a century to accustom them to a national
life out of which England as we have it now was
to spring."</p>

<p>The physical conditions, generally speaking,
are similar on both sides of the Border. Wide
arable expanses, well-wooded and fertile, cover the
chief valleys and much of the Northumbrian
coast-line. But in the main, the landscape is purely
pastoral for miles, showing few signs of human life,
and the nearest habitation often at a considerable
distance. The Northumbrian uplands are confined
chiefly to the Cheviots, the Pyrenees on a small
scale; two-thirds of their whole three hundred
square miles are in the county, constituting
perhaps the loveliest cluster of pastoral hills in the
island. Of this group, Cheviot&mdash;to be more distinctive,
<i>the</i> Cheviot&mdash;(2676 feet) sits in the centre
almost, dignified and massive, the "recumbent guardian
of the great lone moorland." Others, taking
them according to height, are Cairn Hill (2545),
Hedgehope (2348), Comb Fell (2132), Cushat Law
(2020), Bloody Bush Edge (2001), Windy Gyle
(1963), Dunmore (1860), Carter Fell (1600), and
Yeavering Bell (1182)&mdash;a graceful cone overlooking
the pretty hamlet of Kirknewton. A climb to the
broad back of the Cheviot, or the rounded top of
Yeavering, should be made by every tourist who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
rambles along the Border. Both are reachable
from the Scottish and English sides, as by Bowmont
and Colledge Waters, or by that loveliest of all the
upland dales, Langleeford. Despite the somewhat
quagmire character of its flat summit, the view
from the Cheviot, as one might expect, is a truly
inspiring one, comprising the whole coast-line
between Berwick and Tynemouth, and the vast
inland expanse from Midlothian to the Solway&mdash;the
Scottish Border <i>in toto</i>. The Cheviots are hills
rather than the "mountains blue" of poetic
licence. Yet all are imposing to a degree, and
exhibit an excellent contour against the sky-line.
They have none of the wildness and savagery of the
Highland ranges, and even the steepest are grass-grown
from skirt to summit, being easy of ascent,
and commanding the most varied and brilliant
prospects.</p>

<p>Robert Crawford sings of them as "Cheviot
braes so soft and gay," and Gilpin likens the hirsels
browsing on the most acclivitous to pictures hung
on immense green walls. From time immemorial
those charming uplands have been grazed by the
quiet, hardy, fine-wooled, white-faced breed of
sheep which bear their name; and in the days of
the raids (for this is the true "raider-land" of
history) they were resonant, more than any other
part of Scotland, with the clang of freebootery
and the yell of strife. Mrs. Sigourney's apostrophe
to the present day flocks may be quoted:</p>

<p>Of the river valleys running south of the Border
line, the chief are the Breamish, or the Till, as it
is termed from Bewick Brig&mdash;the "sullen Till"
of "Marmion"; the Aln, from Alnham Kirk to
the sand-banks of Alnmouth, a glen emphatically
rich in legendary lore; the Coquet, the most
picturesque and most popular trouting-stream in
the North of England; and Redesdale, redolent
of "Chevy Chase," rising out of Carter Fell, and
joining the North Tyne at Redesmouth, a little
below the pleasant market-town of Bellingham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The chief towns are Berwick and Alnwick, Hexham
being outside our present delimitation. Many
of the smaller places, and the villages, are models
of their kind. Wooler, at the base of the Cheviots,
is a choice mountaineering and angling centre, from
which, by way of Langleeford, is the favourite route
to Cheviot top. It was at the Whitsun Tryst or
Wooler sheep fair, that Scott's grandfather spent
his old shepherd's thirty pounds in buying a horse
instead of sheep, but with such happy results in
the sequel. And hither came Scott himself in
August, 1791, to imbue his mind with the legends,
the history, and scenery of the neighbourhood.
"Behold a letter from the mountains," he writes
to his friend William Clerk, "for I am very snugly
settled here, in a farmer's house (at Langleeford),
about six miles from Wooler, in the very centre
of the Cheviot hills, in one of the wildest and most
romantic situations, which your imagination, fertile
upon the subject of cottages, ever suggested. 'And
what the deuce are you about there?' methinks
I hear you say. Why, sir, of all things in the world,
drinking goat's whey; not that I stand in the least
need of it, but my uncle having a slight cold, and
being a little tired of home, asked me last Sunday
evening if I would like to go with him to Wooler;
and I, answering in the affirmative, next morning's
sun beheld us on our journey through a pass
in the Cheviots, upon the backs of two special nags,
and man Thomas behind with a portmanteau, and
two fishing-rods fastened across his back, much
in the style of St. Andrew's cross. Upon reaching
Wooler we found the accommodation so bad that
we were forced to use some interest to get lodgings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
here, where we are most delightfully appointed,
indeed. To add to my satisfaction we are
amidst places renowned by feats of former days;
each hill is crowned with a tower, or camp, or
cairn; and in no situation can you be near more
fields of battle&mdash;Flodden, Otterburn, and Chevy
Chase. Ford Castle, Chillingham Castle, Coupland
Castle and many another scene of blood are within
the compass of a forenoon's ride. Out of the brooks
with which the hills are intersected, we pull trouts
of half a yard in length, as fast as we did the perches
from the pond at Pennicuik, and we are in the very
country of muirfowl.... My uncle drinks
the whey here, as I do ever since I understood it
was brought to his bedside every morning at six,
by a very pretty dairymaid. So much for my
residence. All the day we shoot, fish, walk, and
ride; dine and sup on fish struggling from the
stream, and the most delicious heath-fed mutton,
barn-door fowls, pies, milk cheese, etc, all in perfection;
and so much simplicity resides amongst
those hills that a pen, which could write at least,
was not to be found about the house, though
belonging to a considerable farmer, till I shot the
crow with whose quill I write this epistle." (See
Lockhart, chapter vi.). In this passage we have
an interesting glimpse of what Northumberland
was a hundred years ago, and of the great author
enjoying a holiday while yet reading for the law,
and before fame began to blow her trumpet in his
praise.</p>

<p>Sweeter villages than Etal and Ford could
scarcely be imagined out of Arcadia. Etal Castle
was destroyed by James IV. previous to Flodden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and has never been restored. Ford Castle, built
originally in 1287, has been frequently renovated
and enlarged, and is now a most excellent example
of the military style of architecture plus the modern
mansion house. Formerly held by the Herons, its
chatelaine figures in "Marmion" as the syren
who detained the King when he ought to have
been in the field. The frescoes in Ford schoolroom,
painted by the late Lady Waterford, are objects
not only of good art but of a well-conceived philanthropy.
Ancroft and Lowick, Chatton and Chillingham
are delightful summer resorts. Chillingham
is famous for its Elizabethan Castle, but still more
so, perhaps, for its herds of wild cattle, the survivors
of the wild ox of Europe, and the supposed
progenitors of our domestic cattle. Other
summer resorts are Belford and Doddington, but
the whole coast-line, indeed, is dotted with the most
desirable holiday-nooks in the county.</p>

<p>The Coquet bears the palm for picturesqueness
amongst Northumbrian valleys, and is about forty
miles in length. From Alwinton, the first village
after crossing the Cheviots, where the Alwine
joins the Coquet&mdash;"a place of slumber and of
dreams remote among the hills"&mdash;to Warkworth
Castle, the stream carries history and romance
in every league of its course. Here are such
names as Biddlestone, the "Osbaldistone," of
"Rob Roy" (there are other claimants such as
Chillingham and Naworth); Harbottle, a hamlet of
venerable antiquity; Holystone, mentioned already
in connection with Paulinus; Hepple, with the
remnant of a strong peel tower of the Ogles; and
Rothbury, the capital of Upper Coquetdale, a snug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
township in the midst of an amphitheatre of the
wild, stony Simonside hills. In the old days it was a
reiving centre of notoriety. All this part of Northumberland,
indeed, was a constant freebooting
arena, neither Scots nor English being content without
some fray on hand. There is not a village, or
a town, or farmhouse even, but has some tale to tell
of that uncanny period. Cragside, Lord Armstrong's
palatial seat, reclaimed, like Abbotsford, from the
barren mountain side, is within a mile of Rothbury.
Then come Brinkburn Priory, "an ancient fabric
awful in repose," founded by William de Bertram,
lord of Mitford, in the reign of Henry I.; Felton, a
neat little village, where Alexander of Scotland
received the homage of the Northumbrian barons;
and Warkworth, "proud of the Percy name," one
of the quaintest and oldest towns in Northumberland,
and teeming with historical and romantic
associations. So near the sea, and with some of the
rarest river scenery in the county close at hand,
the place is in high favour as a holiday resort.
A Saxon settlement, all interest centres around
its dismantled Castle, believed to have been built
by Roger Fitz-Richard, to whom Henry II. granted
in 1158 the manor of Warkworth. Strengthened
from time to time, it became a Percy possession,
and was the chief residence of the family to the
middle of the 15th century. At the height of its
power it must have been well-nigh impregnable,
encircled on three sides by the winding banks and
overhanging woods of the Coquet, and on a commanding
eminence above it; and though time and
many devastating hands have long since riven its
ancient walls, the pile still presents a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
example of a baronial stronghold, second to few
on the Borders.</p>

<p>Among Northumbrian towns, Alnwick (the
county town) ranks next to Newcastle. But
whilst the rise of the latter and its prosperity and
colour have been each affected by the great industrial
changes of the century, Alnwick's development
has been very different. Lying peacefully
amidst pastoral hills, by the side of a river unpolluted
by modern commerce, this ancient Border
town still presents the plain and austere aspect
which it wore when the great stage-coaches passed
through on their way from London to Edinburgh.
In Newcastle, despite its numerous relics of antiquity,
one's mind is ever dominated by the potent
Present, whereas in Alnwick, it is ever under
the spell of the dreamy Past. The quaint, irregular
stone-built houses are touched with the sober hues
of antiquity, and seem to take their character from
the great baronial relic of feudal times. The
history of the town is chiefly a record of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old unhappy far-off things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battles long ago."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was founded by the Saxons, who styled it Alainwick,
"the town on the clear water." Like Carlisle,
its history is largely one of attack and retaliation.
The Scottish Sovereigns were peculiarly unfortunate
at Alnwick. For here Malcolm Canmore was
speared to death in 1093, and William the Lion
made prisoner in 1174, and inside the castle of
to-day with its gilded ceilings, luxurious upholstery,
and majestic mantels of Italian workmanship
and marbles, are still to be seen the dour dungeons
in which many a Scot died miserably while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Percy and his retainers feasted above. King
John burned Alnwick to the ground in 1216, David
I. besieged and captured it. Each of the Edwards
visited the place. It was again devastated by the
Scots in 1427. In 1463, it was held for Edward
IV., and in 1464 it fell into the hands of Queen
Margaret. Royalists and Roundheads occupied
Alnwick during the wars between Charles and his
Parliament, but after 1700 it settled down to comparative
quiet. The Castle, of course, dominates
the place. There is what William Howitt calls "an
air of solemn feudality" overhanging the whole
town. Streets and buildings, and the general
tone harmonize well with the prevailing conditions.
Only one of its four gates survives&mdash;the gloomy, old,
weather-beaten Bondgate, built by the haughty
Hotspur about the year 1450. The Cross dates
from the same period. The most interesting and
venerable structure is the Church of St. Mary and
St. Michael, founded about the beginning of the
14th century, Perpendicular in style, and abundant
in Percy memorials. But the chief object of interest
is the Castle with the Castle enclosure (some five
acres in extent). The Castle itself is the most
magnificent specimen of a feudal fortress in England,
a verdict in which all who see it will agree. What
an extraordinarily fascinating and profoundly impressive
place, from the very stones of the courtyard
to the defiant-looking warrior figures on the
battlements of the barbican, and elsewhere. What
an endless succession of towers and turrets (some
of them with distinctive names, Hotspur and
Bloody Gap) archways and corridors, walls and
embrasures, and all the grim massive paraphernalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of the past, apparently as doggedly determined as
ever. Perhaps, as one writer puts it, only a Percy
could live quite at his ease as master of Alnwick
Castle. One cannot imagine the average man
making himself congenially at home here. But
the inside comforts are an overflowing compensation
for a somewhat forbidding exterior. We are told
that even the towers at the angles of the encircling
walls are museums of British and Egyptian antiquities,
and game trophies, collected by members
of the family. The fourth Duke has left much to
show for the quarter of a million he lavished upon
the building&mdash;exquisite wood carving, frescoes,
marbles, and canvases. Mantovani, who restored
the Raphael frescoes in the Vatican, was not too
great a man to be hired by a Percy to adorn his
Border castle. The walls of the grand staircase
are panelled with beautiful marbles. There are
unique paintings: the dining-room, a noble apartment,
is pompous with Percys in fine frames, bewigged,
robed and plain; the first Duke and his
wife, who helped him to a dignity neither his money
nor his courtly manners could have won for him,
hang suitably in the place of honour above the
hearth. Vandyck, Moroni, and Andrea del Sarto
are worthily represented in the castle. Giorgione,
who did so well the comparatively little he had
time for, is here in his "Lady with the Lute."
Raphael, Guido, and Titian are also within these
swarthy outer walls, Titian's landscape contribution
being specially notable, like Giovanni Bellini's
"The Gods enjoying the Fruits of the Earth."
One looks from it to the fair Northumberland
country beyond the windows and then at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
splendour and taste of the castle, and fancies,
inevitably, that the Percys themselves have in
these later days obtained quite their share of the
privileges of Bellini's gods. Nothing that makes
for domestic pleasure is lacking at Alnwick Castle.
There is a stately library of some 15,000 books,
with chairs for dreaming and chairs for study;
and, not to slight meaner comforts, there is a
kitchen that is a model of its baronial kind, about
fifty yards distant from the dining-hall, with which
it communicates by an underground passage.
The first English possession acquired by the house
of Percy north of the Tees was Dalton, afterwards
called Dalton-Percy. Then came Alnwick, originally
owned by the De Vescis, and purchased from them
about 1309; Warkworth; Prudhoe-on-Tyne, one
of the most picturesque of Northumbrian fortresses;
Cockermouth; and Keeldar, in the Cheviots. And
what of the Percys who ruled, and still rule, at
Alnwick in their day of might? Very ancient is
the name, numbering among its early patriarchs
such grand old heroes as Manfred the Dane, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Brave Galfred, who to Normandy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vent'rous Rollo came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his Norman Castles won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assumed the Percy name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pedigree traces the descent of Angus de Perci
up to Manfred, and that of Josceline de Louvain
up from Gerberga, daughter and heiress of Charles,
Duke of Lorraine, to Charlemagne, and in the
male line to the ancient Dukes of Hainault. This
same Josceline, who was brother-in-law to King
Henry I., married in 1168, Agnes, the great Percy
heiress, and assumed the name of his wife:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lord Percy's heir I was, whose noble name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me survives unto his lasting fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brabant's Duke's son I wed, who, for my sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retained his arms, and Percy's name did take."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Their youngest son, Richard de Percy, then head
of the family, was one of the chief barons who
extorted Magna Charta from King John, and the
ninth Lord, Henry, gave much aid to Edward I.
in the subjugation of Scotland. It was he who
purchased Alnwick. His son&mdash;another Henry&mdash;defeated
David II. at Neville's Cross (1346); his
grandson fought at Crécy; his great-grandson,
the fourth Lord Percy of Alnwick, was marshal of
England at the coronation of Richard II., and was
created the same day Earl of Northumberland.
By far the greater part of the romance of the Percys
has centred round Harry Hotspur (eldest son of the
preceding), whom the dead Douglas defeated at
Otterburn, and who fell himself at Shrewsbury
(1403) fighting against Henry IV. The soubriquet
of Hotspur was given him because "in the silence
of the night, when others were quietly sleeping, he
laboured unwearied, as though his spur were hot."</p>

<p>The first Earl was slain at Bramham Moor
(1408). The second Earl fell fighting for Henry
VI. at St. Albans in 1455. The third at Towton
(1461), and it was his brother the fourth Earl who
comforted himself as he lay bleeding to death on
Hedgley Moor (1464) that he had "saved the bird
in his bosom." The fifth Earl was murdered in
1489. The sixth Earl was the lover of Anne Boleyn,
maid of honour to Queen Catherine, and had King
Henry VIII. for his rival, who in great wrath
commanded Cardinal Wolsey to break off the
engagement between them. The seventh Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
for espousing the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, was
beheaded in 1572. The eighth Earl in 1585 was
found dead in bed with three pistol shots through
his breast, whether by suicide or murder. The
ninth Earl was imprisoned for fifteen years in the
Tower on a baseless suspicion of being privy to
the Gunpowder Plot. The tenth Earl fought on
the Parliamentary side in the Civil War, and with
the death of Josceline, the eleventh Earl, in 1670,
the male line of the family came to an end. The
eleventh Earl's only child&mdash;an heiress&mdash;married
the Duke of Somerset, who was created in 1749
Baron Warkworth, and Earl of Northumberland,
with remainder (having no male issue) to his son-in-law
Sir Hugh Smithson, of Stanwick, a Yorkshire
knight who in his youth had been an apothecary
in Hatton Gardens. Sir Hugh succeeded to the
Earldom in 1750, and was created in 1766 Earl
Percy and Duke of Northumberland. The seventh
Duke succeeded in 1899.</p>

<p>From Alnwick it is fourteen miles to Bamborough,
"King Ida's castle, huge and square."
No traveller along the great north road between
Alnwick and Berwick can fail to be struck with
an object so boldly prominent as Bamborough.
Far and wide it meets the vision, and is the more
conspicuous from the flat character of its surroundings
and the very open coast. Its base is an almost
perpendicular mass of basaltic rock overlooking
the sea, at a height of 150 feet. Founded in 547, it
suffered many a siege, most of all at the hands of
the Danes in 933. In the years that followed it
was being constantly rebuilt, and as constantly
stormed and broken again. As the great bombards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
left it in the fourth Edward's reign, so it lay dismantled
for centuries. In 1720, Lord Crewe, the
philanthropic Bishop of Durham, purchased the
Castle and bequeathed it for charitable purposes&mdash;the
reception and care of the poor, etc. In
1894 it was acquired by the late Lord Armstrong,
at a cost of a quarter of a million, and fitted up as
a convalescent home. The charming village of
Bamborough, nestling within easy distance, has
some celebrity as a health resort. The church in
which St. Aidan died is one of the oldest in the
country, and the churchyard contains Grace Darling's
tomb. The Farne Islands, the scene of her
brave exploit, are easily visible from the shore.
There are seventeen in all, forming three distinct
groups, Longstone, the heroine's home, lying
farthest out. It was from the lighthouse on this
latter island that the noble maiden of barely twenty-two
descried the wreck of the <i>Forfarshire</i>, the 7th
September, 1838, and formed her resolve at rescue.
"He that goes out and sees the savage and iron
nature of the rocks will not avoid wondering at
the desperate nature of the attempt," crowned
by an almost superhuman triumph. On the great
Farne, or House Island, his favourite place of
retirement, St. Cuthbert died in 687. How his
followers bore, from shrine to shrine, the uncorrupted
body of their Bishop is a tradition well-known.
"For the space of seven years," says Reginald of
Durham, "Saint Cuthbert was carried to and fro
on the shoulders of pious men through trackless
and waterless places; when no house afforded him
a hospitable roof, he remained under covering of
tents." Further, we are told how the monks first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
carried their precious burden to the stone church
at Norham; thence towed it up the river to
Tillmouth; on to Melrose, the Saint's home-sanctuary
by the Tweed; thence through the
Lowland glens towards the English Border where,
descending the head-waters of the Tyne, they came
to Hexham; passing westward to Carlisle in
Cumberland, and Dufton Fells in Westmoreland,
and over into Lancashire; then once more eastward
to the monastery at York; and finally
northward again to a last resting place in Durham,
when</p>

</div></div>

<h3><a name="MerrieCarlisle" id="MerrieCarlisle">"MERRIE CARLISLE"</a></h3>

<p>A glance at the outskirts of Carlisle suggests
at once the fact that its founders had considered
the strategic value of the site. The
old Brigantes never planted their towns without
due examination of the whole lie of the land,
and especially with a view to its defencibleness.
The river-junctions were often their favourite
settling places. Hence the origin of Carlisle, and
many others of the Border towns&mdash;Hawick, Selkirk,
Kelso, etc. With its three encompassing streams&mdash;the
Eden, the Caldew, and the Petteril, which
still enclose the Castle and Cathedral hills in a sort
of quasi-island, Carlisle has been aptly called
"the city of the waters." Its situation certainly
is all but perfect, whilst the picturesqueness and the
extensiveness of its surrounding scenery are the
admiration of all who see it. Built upon a hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
which its walls once enclosed but which would now
shut out its most populous suburbs, Carlisle commands
a prospect only limited by the lofty mountain
chain that encircles the great basin in which
Cumberland lies. From the summit of the Cathedral
or from the Keep of the Castle, the eye sweeps without
interruption a vast prepossessing landscape, rich
in wood and water and fertile valleys, over which the
light and shade are ever gambolling, and the seasons
spreading their variegated hues. Southward, across
this fair expanse, the majestic Skiddaw rears his
noble crest, and Helvellyn his wedge-like peak,
radiant with the first and last rays of the sun.
Saddleback, and the lesser hills, link the apparently
unbroken chain with Crossfell and the eastern
range; while further to the left the Northumberland
fells bound the horizon. Then come the uplands
by Bewcastle and the Border and the pastoral
Cheviots. Away round to the west, the magnificent
belt is terminated by "huge Criffel's hoary top"
standing in solemn grandeur above the Solway.</p>

<p>There are few fairer or wider panoramas in
Britain, and none more permeated with the very
spirit of romance. What Lockhart said of Sandyknowe
is equally true of this singularly fascinating
view-point. To whichever hand we turn we may be
sure there is "not a field but has its battle, and not
a rivulet without its song."</p>

<p>Unlike Melrose, which may claim to be the literary
capital of the Border Country, Carlisle is the
fighting capital. Its most stirring memories are of
raiders and rescues, and its very air is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"full of ballad notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne out of long ago."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Despite its Cathedral, Carlisle is really more Scottish
than English. A town which proclaimed the
Pretender must be Scottish enough. No other
English town fills so large a place in Scottish history.
And even its present manners and customs, and no
little part of its dialect, are coloured with Scottish
sentiment and tradition. For which it cannot be
a whit the worse! Walk about Carlisle, and one
is charmed with the exquisite pleasantness of the
place, the sense of comfort and prosperity that
reigns in its streets and suburbs, the steady flow of
traffic running through it, and the welcome geniality
of its inhabitants. What a delightful spot is Stanwix
yonder, for instance! And the banks of
the Eden have something of those "Eden scenes"
about them which Burns claimed for the Jed.
That Bridge is not unlike Rennie's at Kelso. The
public buildings are worth a more minute examination
than the passing stranger usually gives. An
atmosphere of delicious semi-antiquity is the crowning
feature of "Merrie Carlisle," and one feels
instinctively that under the inevitable modernity
of the place there is an older story written on its
stones&mdash;</p>

<p>It is so old a town that one cannot be certain of
its origin. The name is apparently British, derived
probably from <i>Caer Lywelydd</i>, or simply Caer
Lywel, "the town or fort of Lywel," but whether
this was a tribal, or local, or personal name it would
be hazardous to say. By the Romans it was known
as <i>Luguvallium</i> or <i>Luguballia</i>, possibly "the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
or fort by the Wall." This the Saxons abbreviated
and altered to <i>Luel</i>, the original name, with the
prefix <i>Caer</i>, hence Caer-Luel, Caerleil, Carleol,
Karluil, Karliol, Carliol, Carlile, and Carlisle.</p>

<p>"No English city," says Bishop Creighton,
"has a more distinctive character than Carlisle,
and none can claim to have borne its character
so continuously through the course of English
history. Carlisle is still known as 'the Border
city,' and though the term 'the Border' has no
longer any historical significance, it still denotes a
district which has strongly marked peculiarities
and retains a vigorous provincial life. There was
a time when the western Border was equally important
with the Border on the north, when the
fortress on the Dee had to be stoutly held against
the foe, and when the town which rose among the
scrub by the upper Severn was a place of conflict
between contending races. But this struggle was
not of long duration, and Chester and Shrewsbury
ceased to be distinctly Border towns. On the north,
however, the contest continued to be stubbornly
waged, till it raised up a population inured to warfare,
who carried the habits of a predatory life
into a time when they were mere survivals of a
well-nigh forgotten past. Of this period of conflict
Carlisle is the monument, and of this lawless life
it was long the capital. Berwick-upon-Tweed
alone could venture to share its glory or dispute
its supremacy; but Berwick was scarcely a town;
it was rather a military outpost, changing hands
from time to time between the combatants; it
was neither Scottish nor English, more than a
castle, but less than a town, an accidental growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of circumstances, scarcely to be classed as an
element of popular life. Carlisle, on the other
hand, traces its origin to times of venerable antiquity,
and can claim through all its changes to have
carried on in unbroken succession the traditions
of an historic life. It was the necessary centre
of a large tract of country, and whether its inhabitants
were British or English its importance remained
the same. It was not merely a military
position, but a place of habitation, the habitation
of a people who had to trust much to themselves,
and who amidst all vicissitudes retained a sturdy
spirit of independence. This is the distinguishing
feature of Carlisle; it is 'the Border city.' But
though this is its leading characteristic which runs
through all its history, it has two other marks of
distinction, when compared with other English
towns. It is the only town on British soil which
bears a purely British name; and it is the only
town which has been added to England since the
Norman Conquest."</p>

</div>

<p>Briefly, the headlines of Carlisle's history are
these. Founded originally by the Britons, it was
held by the Romans for close on four centuries.
Many Roman remains (coins, medals, altars, etc.)
have been unearthed, and Hadrian's big Wall
(murus and vallum) is still traceable in several
quarters. A sad spoliation by Pict and Scot
followed the Roman withdrawal. They scarcely
left one stone on another. Then came the Saxon
supremacy under the good King Egfrith, with the
spiritual oversight under Saint Cuthbert, to whom
and his successors at Lindisfarne were bestowed
in perpetuity the city with fifteen miles around it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
But for Egfrith's death fighting the Picts on the
far-off moorland of Nechtansmere (Dunnichen in
Forfarshire) Carlisle might have risen early and
rapidly to a sure place as one of the leading cities in
the land. From 685, however, to the Conquest (1066)
the place was virtually extinct. It was only then that
a new epoch arose for the broken city as for the whole
of England. The Conqueror himself is said to have
commenced the rebuilding of Carlisle, but the
town owes its restoration rather to his son William
the Red, who, on his return from Alnwick, after
concluding a peace treaty with the King of Scotland
in 1092, "observed the pleasantness of its situation,
and resolved to raise it from its ruins." The Castle,
the Priory, the once massive city walls, were all
the work of the Rufus regime, completed by Henry
I., who gave cathedral dignity to the church at
Carlisle. David I., the "Sair Sanct," raided Carlisle
in 1136, and kept court for a time within its
walls, which he heightened. It was at Carlisle
that his death took place in 1153. From that
date to the 'Forty-five, Carlisle's history is mainly
that of a kind of "buffer-state" between the two
kingdoms. Few cities recall so many martial
memories. It was Edward's base of operations in
his Scottish wars. It was besieged by Wallace in
1298, by Bruce in 1315&mdash;the year after Bannockburn,
and again in 1322. Queen Mary's captivity
at Carlisle in 1568; Buccleuch's daring and gallant
rescue of Kinmont Willie in 1596, immortalised in
the best of the Border ballads; the protracted
siege by General Leslie in 1644 during the Parliamentary
War; and the Pretender's short-lived
triumph&mdash;these are the rest of its leading events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the historic Carlisle little is left, the Castle,
the Cathedral, and the Guildhall being almost the sole
relics of a long and notable past. Yet how vastly
changed the place is from the quiet little Border
town of a century ago even! Then it had barely
ten thousand inhabitants, now there are over forty
thousand. As the county town of Cumberland,
and next to Newcastle the greatest railway centre
in the north of England, its prosperity has grown
by leaps and bounds. It is the terminus of no
fewer than eight different lines, and its busy,
never-at-rest Citadel Station is known all the
world over. Gates and walls have long since
vanished from "Merrie Carlisle." The streets are
wide and airy, and altogether it presents a most
comfortable and thriving appearance. At 40, English
Street, the chief thoroughfare, Prince Charlie slept
for four nights during the '45. And from 79 to 83,
Castle Street, the corner building (now a solicitor's
office), between Castle Street and the Green-market,
Scott led Miss Carpenter to the altar. Carlisle
Castle, a huge, irregular reddish-brown stone structure,
grim and defiant, with its almost perfect
specimen of a Norman Keep, and battlements
frowning towards the north, is still a place to see.</p>

<p>But it is the Cathedral which is Carlisle's
chief glory. Rising in the centre of the city, high
above all other buildings except the factory chimneys,
there is an air of importance about it not
altogether justifiable. The building is small and
not of very great account, the reason being that
Carlisle was only erected into a See in 1133, and then
out of Durham. The result was that the parish
church was promoted to the dignity of a cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Nevertheless, it has several striking features&mdash;a
delightful Early English choir and magnificent
east window, reputed to be unsurpassed by any
other in the kingdom, if indeed in the world. From
1092, the date of the original building, to 1400-19,
in Bishop Strickland's time, when the north transept
was restored and the central tower rebuilt,
and down to the present day, the edifice contains
every variety of style, from Norman to Perpendicular,
with admirable specimens of nineteenth
century work. Of the original Norman minster
the only parts remaining are two bays of the nave,
the south transept, and the piers of the tower.
How long the church remained in its pristine state
it is impossible to say. The first alteration was
probably the enlargement of the choir, towards
the middle and close of the thirteenth century,
immediately before the great fire of 1292, the worst
the cathedral has experienced in its four burnings.
The work of reconstruction after 1292 appears to
have been somewhat slow, so slow that little was
done till the year 1352, when Bishop Welton and
his successor set themselves in earnest to the task.
"The king, the city treasury, and the leading
families of the neighbourhood contributed towards
the restoration, in response to the urgent appeals
of the bishops and to the indulgences issued for the
remission of forty days' penance to such laity as
should by money, materials, or labour, contribute
to the pious work." Towards the close of the
reign of Edward III. the renovated pile rose from
it ruins. To this period belongs the entire east end,
with its grand window, the triforium, the carved
capitals of the arches, and the Decorated windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the clerestory. The ceiling was painted and
gilded and panelled, the intersections glowing with
the armorial bearings of the rich donors by whose
liberality the work had been carried to completion.
The windows were filled with stained glass, and
the nine lights of the east window with figures.</p>

</div>

<p>In this state the cathedral appears to have
remained till 1392, when another fire occurred,
which destroyed the north transept. A lack of
funds was again felt, and it was not till the lapse
of nine or ten years that the restoration was completed.
Only about a century later, however,
Carlisle shared the fate of the monastic institutions,
and was suppressed, and the church shorn of many
of its enrichments. The Civil Wars witnessed the
worst acts of spoliation, when nearly the whole
of the nave, the chapter-house and cloisters were
destroyed, the materials being used for guard-house
purposes in the city. The reign of the "Puritan
patchwork" may then be said to have begun,
with plaster partitions here and there in horrifying
evidence, the niches emptied of their treasures,
and the fine old stained glass removed from the
windows&mdash;and all, as was declared, in the spirit of
"repairing and beautifying." "A great, wild
country church," is its description about this time,
"and as it appeared outwardly, so it was inwardly,
ne'er beautify'd, nor adorn'd one whit." Not till
1853-57 was a general restoration, costing £15,000,
inaugurated. Both internally and externally the
edifice underwent a total renovation. Old and
crumbled portions were pulled down and rebuilt;
other parts were fronted anew; missing ornaments
were supplied; ugly doorways were blocked up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and one grand entrance made befitting the church.
The renaissance was complete as it was judicious.
There was just sufficient of the old left to show
the original structure, and sufficient of the new
imparted to save the venerable fane from crumbling
to pieces. Externally, the east is certainly the
finest part of the building, with its unrivalled
window&mdash;58 feet high and 32&frac12; feet wide, of nine
lights, gracefully proportioned, the head filled
with the most exquisite tracery-work, comprising
no fewer than 263 circles. A uniquely ornamented
gable, with a row of crosses on either shoulder,
and a large cross at the apex, completes a highly
finished centre. On either side stands out, in
massive relief, a majestic buttress, containing full
length statues of St. Peter, St. Paul, St James,
and St. John, above which are light and elegant
pinnacles. These great buttresses are flanked by
the lesser ones of the aisles, tapering upwards with
chastely carved spires&mdash;the whole forming an
eastern front of great beauty and richness. The
main entrance by a new doorway in the south
transept is a triumph of the sculptor's skill. The
great tower, 112 feet high, has been thoroughly
renovated, and much of its former ornamentation
restored. Of the interior, the nave is in length
39 feet, and in width about 60 feet. The Scots
are said to have destroyed 100 feet of it in 1645,
but that is quite uncertain. It has never been
rebuilt, and has a serious effect on the general
proportions, inducing a feeling of want of balance.
Up to 1870 the nave was used as the parish church
of St. Mary, and it was here&mdash;close by the great
Norman columns&mdash;that Sir Walter Scott was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
married to Charlotte Carpenter, on December 24th,
1797. The spot might well be indicated by a small
memorial brass. The richly-decorated choir, in
no respect inferior to that of any other English
cathedral, is 134 feet long, 71 feet broad, and 75
feet high. The warm red of the sandstone, the
blue roof powdered with golden stars, the great
east window filled with stained glass, and the dark
oak of the stalls, make up a picture that enforces
attention before the architectural details can receive
their due admiration.</p>

<p>The Cathedral contains several interesting
monuments. Here is the tomb of Archdeacon Paley
(1805), author of the "Evidences of Christianity"
and "Horæ Paulinæ," both written at Carlisle,
and the richly-carved pulpit inscribed to his memory.
There are tablets to Robert Anderson (1833), the
"Cumberland Bard;" to John Heysham, M.D.
(1834), the statistician, and compiler of the "Carlisle
Tables of Mortality;" George Moore (1876), the
philanthropist; M. L. Watson (1847), the sculptor;
Dean Cranmer (1848), Canon Harcourt (1870), and
Dean Close (1882). Several military monuments
are in evidence. One of the windows commemorates
the five children of Archbishop Tait (then Dean),
who died between March 6th and April 9th, 1856.
Recumbent figures of Bishop Waldegrave (1869),
Bishop Harvey Goodwin (1891) and Dean Close
are by Acton Adams, Hamo Thorneycroft, R.A.,
and H. H. Armistead, R.A., respectively. The
older altar-tombs and brasses to Bishop Bell,
Bishop Everdon, and Prior Stenhouse, should not
be overlooked, and attention may be drawn also to
the quaint series of fifth-century paintings from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the monkish legends of St. Augustine, St. Anthony,
and St. Cuthbert, and to the misereres of the
stalls.</p>

<p>Scarcely less interesting than Carlisle itself is
the immediate neighbourhood of the Border city.
And with what sterling picturesqueness does it
appeal to us! One does not wonder that Turner
and others found some of their masterpieces here.
A wondrously historic countryside, too, is all this
pleasantly-rolling tableland, mile upon mile to
the Liddesdale and Eskdale heights with the
Langholm Monument fairly visible as a rule, and
sometimes even the famous Repentance Tower
opposite Hoddom Kirk. Within twenty miles or
so of Carlisle, up through the old Waste and Debateable
Lands, or over into the romantic Vale of the
Irthing, the dividing-point betwixt Cumberland
and Northumberland, the district is full of the most
fascinating material for the geographer and the
historian. It is impossible to do more than mention
a few of its memory-moving names. At Burghby-Sands,
Edward I., "the Hammer of the Scots,"
having offered up his litter before the high altar
at Carlisle, vowing to reduce Scotland to the condition
of a mere English province, was forced to
succumb to a grimmer adversary than lay anywhere
beyond the Solway. Bowness-by-the-Sea
was the western terminus of the Roman Wall.
Arthuret has its name from the "Flower of Kings,"
one of whose twelve battles is said to have been
fought there. Archie Armstrong, jester to King
James VI., lies buried in its churchyard. At
Longtown, on the Esk, the Jacobite troops forded
the river "shouther to shouther," as Lady Nairne's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
lyric has it, dancing reels on the bank till they
had dried themselves. Netherby, the <i>locale</i> of
"Young Lochinvar," Lady Heron's song in "Marmion,"
is in the near neighbourhood. So are Gilnockie
or the Hollows, Johnie Armstrong's home,
and Gretna Green, that once so popular but now
defunct shrine of Venus. All this once bleak and
barren bog-land is under generous cultivation now to
a large extent, stretching from the Sark to the Esk,
and eastward to Canonbie Lea; it was the
treacherously Debateable, or No Man's Land of
moss-trooping times, the most troubled and unsafe
period of Border history. Solway Moss, some
seven miles in circumference, is not likely to be
forgotten&mdash;by Scotsmen, at any rate. It was the
disastrous Rout of the Solway which hastened
James V.'s death from a broken heart.</p>

<p>The Irthing valley is replete with historical
remains and literary associations. Over there, to the
north of Bewcastle (Beuth's Castle), there is a celebrated
Runic Cross nearly fifteen feet high, of the
Caedmon order, similar to that at Ruthwell. The
Irthing flows through the wide moorish wilderness
known as Spade-Adam, or the Waste, crosses the
Roman Wall at Gilsland, thence courses amongst
some of the richest scenery in Cumberland until
it meets the Eden. Gilsland Spa has long been
noted for the excellence of its waters and the remarkable
salubrity of the district. Scott stayed at the
old Shaw's Hotel in July, 1797, not the present
palatial Convalescent Home (as it now is) which
was rebuilt after a fire about fifty years since.
Charlotte Carpenter was a guest at Wardrew House,
directly opposite. They met often, and the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was love and marriage. On a huge boulder by the
banks of the Irthing, where the glen comes to its
steepest and wears its most enchanting aspect,
Scott is said to have "popped the question," and the
"Kissing Bush" where the compact was sealed is
also pointed out close by. At Gilsland it is interesting
to recall that one is to some extent in "Guy Mannering
Land." A small private dwelling adjoining
the Methodist Chapel claims to stand on the site
of the notorious Mumps Ha', "a hedge ale-house,
where the Border farmers of either country
often stopped to refresh themselves and their nags
on their way to and from the fairs and trysts in
Cumberland." It was there that young Harry
Bertram first met Dandie Dinmont and the weird
figure of Meg Merrilies, who, by the way, was not
buried at Upper Denton, as the guide-books say.
It was the treacherous landlady, Meg Mumps or
Margaret Carrick, who is there interred. The more
important Meg&mdash;the real heroine of the story&mdash;was
drowned in the Eden at Carlisle. Gilsland is a
centre for some delightful excursions. Much of
the Roman Wall may be visited from this centre,
its two chief stations Borcovicus (Housesteads) and
Burdoswald being within easy distances. The
little Northumberland lakes, and the prettiest of
them all, Crag Loch, the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall,
seen from the Shaws with fine effect, Thirlwall and
Blenkinsop Castles, Haltwhistle Church, all to the
east, are objects of deep and abiding interest. Westward
are Burdoswald&mdash;the Roman Amboglanna&mdash;covering
an area of 5&frac12; acres, and overlooking a
singularly graceful bend of the Irthing (not unlike
that on the Tweed at Bemersyde); Lanercost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>

<h2><a name="III_THE_TWEED_AND_ITS" id="III_THE_TWEED_AND_ITS"></a>III. THE TWEED AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS.</h2>

<p>"Both are good, the streams of north and
south, but he who has given his heart to
the Tweed as did Tyro in Homer to the
Enipeus, will never change his love." So does
Mr. Andrew Lang remind us of his affection for
Tweedside and the Border. Elsewhere he speaks
of Tweed shrining the music of his cradle song, and
the requiem he would most prefer&mdash;may that day
be long in coming!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"No other hymn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd choose, nor gentler requiem dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Tweed's, that through death's twilight dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourned in the latest Minstrel's ear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lockhart's description of Sir Walter's death-scene,
so touching in its very simplicity, has never been
matched in literary biography. From the first
years of his life, Scott was wedded to the Tweed.
It was his ancestral stream. And it stood for all that
was best and fairest in Border story. It was by the
Tweed that he won his greatest triumphs, and faced
his greatest defeats, where he spent the happiest
as well as the most strenuous period of his career.
So that, to breathe his last breath by its pleasant
banks&mdash;a desire oft repeated&mdash;was as natural as it
was keen and eager. We know how at length
he was borne back to Abbotsford, the house of his
dreams, and how on one of those ideal days during
the early autumn that crowning wish was realised;
"It was a beautiful day, so warm that every window
was wide open, and so perfectly still that the sound
of all others most delicious to his ear&mdash;the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
ripple of the Tweed over its pebbles&mdash;was distinctly
audible as we knelt around the bed and his
eldest son kissed and closed his eyes."</p>

<p>Of course, it is owing, in great measure, to
Scott that the Tweed has so exalted a place in
literature. To speak of the Tweed at once recalls
Scott and all that the Tweed meant to him. Both
in a sense are names inseparable and synonymous.
It is almost entirely for Scott's sake that Tweedside
has become one of the world-Meccas. What Scott
did for the Tweed&mdash;the Border&mdash;renders it (to speak
reverently) holy ground for ever. Hence the
affection with which the world looks on Scott&mdash;as
a patriot,&mdash;as one who has helped to create his
country, and as a great literary magnet attracting
thousands to it, and as the medium of some of the
most pleasurable of mental experiences. Of the
great names on Scotland's roll of honour, Scott,
even more than all of them (even more than
Burns), has wedded his country to the very best
of humankind everywhere. But do not let us
forget that Tweed had its lovers many before
Scott's day. Burns's pilgrimage to the Border
was a picturesque episode in his poetic history.
"Yarrow and Tweed to monie a tune owre Scotland
rings," he wrote, and other lines represent a warm
admiration for the district. Tweed was a "wimpling
stately" stream, and there were "Eden scenes
on crystal Jed" scarcely less fascinating. James
Thomson, the poet of the "Seasons," a Tweedsider,
though the fact is often forgotten, pays
grateful homage to the Tweed as the "pure parent-stream,
whose pastoral banks first heard my Doric
reed." Allan Ramsay and Robert Crawford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
West-country men both, came early under the spell
of the fair river. Crawford's lines are painted
with the usual exaggeration of the period:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Robert Fergusson&mdash;Burns's "elder brother in
the Muses," had his imagination fired by the
memories of the Border, and was one of the first to
celebrate that land over which lies the light of so
much poetic fancy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Arno and the Tiber lang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hae run full clear in Roman sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, save the reverence o' schools!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They're baith but lifeless dowy pools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dought they compare wi' bonny Tweed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clear as ony lammer-bead?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wordsworth, too, sang of the "gentle Tweed, and
the green silent pastures," though his winsome
Three Yarrows is the tie that most endears him to
the Lowland hearts. Since Scott's day the voices
in praise of Tweed have been legion. "Who, with
a heart and a soul tolerably at ease within him,
could fail to be happy, hearing as we do now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
voice of the Tweed, singing his pensive twilight
song to the few faint stars that have become visible
in heaven?" says John Wilson in his rollicking
"Streams" essay (no "crusty Christopher" there, at
any rate). Thomas Tod Stoddart, king of angling
rhymers,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Angled far and angled wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Fannich drear, by Luichart's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across dark Conan's current,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and all over Scotland, but found not another stream
to match with the Tweed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Dearer than all these to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sylvan Tweed; each tower and tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in its vale rejoices;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearer the streamlets one and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blend with its Eolian brawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own enamouring voices!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Remember, too, Dr. John Brown's exquisite Tweed's
Well meditation, a prose sermon to ponder over
any Sabbath, and Ruskin's homely reverie&mdash;"I
can never hear the whispering and sighing of the
Tweed among his pebbles, but it brings back to
me the song of my nurse as we used to cross
by Coldstream Bridge, from the south, in our
happy days&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For Scotland, my darling, lies full in my view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her barefooted lasses, and mountains so blue."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One thinks also of George Borrow's fascination
for the Scottish Border, when he asks ("Lavengro")
"Which of the world's streams can Tweed envy,
with its beauty and renown?" and of Thomas
Aird's pathetic retrospect&mdash;"the ever-dear Tweed,
whose waters flow continually through my heart,
and make me often greet in my lonely evenings."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Nor do we forget John Veitch, that truest Tweedsman
of his time, always musing on the Tweed,
never at home but beside it, and of whose Romance
and History there has been no abler exponent.</p>

<p>Of the name Tweed itself, the meaning and
origin are uncertain, and it is hopeless to dogmatize
on the subject except to say that there is an apparent
connection with the Cymric Tay, Taff, Teith,
and Teviot&mdash;more properly "Teiott," the common
pronunciation above Hawick. Mr. Johnston
("Place-Names of Scotland") traces it to the Celtic
<i>twyad</i>&mdash;"a hemming in"&mdash;from "<i>twy</i> to check or
bind," which is a not unlikely derivation. As
to the source of the Tweed there is the curious
paradox that what passes for its source is not the
real <i>fons et origo</i> of the stream. Poetically, the
Tweed is said to take its rise in the tiny Tweed's
Well among the Southern Highlands, 1250 feet
above sea level, and close to where the marches of
Peeblesshire, Lanarkshire, and Dumfriesshire meet.
But strictly speaking, the correct source is the Cor
or Corse Burn, a little higher up, which, dancing
its way to the glen beneath, receives the outflow
of the Well as a sort of first tributary. For purposes
of romance, however, Tweed's Well will always
be reckoned as the source, as indeed it must have
been so regarded ages ago. The likelihood is that
Tweed's Well was one of the ancient holy wells
common to many parts of Scotland. And since tradition
speaks of a Mungo's Well somewhere in these solitudes,
the probability is that we have it here in
the heart of these silent lonely hills. There is the
tradition of a cross, too, at or near Tweed's Well,
borne out in the place-name Corse, which, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
know, is good Scots for Cross. That such a symbol
of the ancient faith stood here long since "to
remind travellers of their Redeemer and to guide
them withal across these desolate moors," is more
than a mere picturesque legend. It is a prolific
watershed this from which Tweed starts its seaward
race. South and west, Annan and Clyde
bend their way to the Solway and the Atlantic,
as the quaint quatrain has it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Annan, Tweed, and Clyde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise a' oot o' ae hillside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tweed ran, Annan wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clyde brak his neck owre Corra Linn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tweed turns its face to the north, and running for
the most part, as old Pennecuik puts it, "with a
soft yet trotting stream," it pursues a course of
slightly over a hundred miles, and drains a basin
of no less than 1870 square miles, a larger area than
any other Scottish river except the Tay.</p>

<p>Tweed's Well lies in the bosom of solemn, bare
hills. There is nothing attractive about the spot.
Grey moorlands, riddled with innumerable inky
peat-bogs, the whaups crying as Stevenson heard
them in his dreams, and the bleat of an occasional
sheep are the chief characteristics. There is little
heather, and the hills are hardly so shapely as their
neighbours further down the valley. A first glance
is disappointing, but the memories of the place
are compensation enough. For what a stirring
place it must have been in the early centuries!
Here, as tradition asserts, the pagan bard Merlin
was converted to Christianity through the preaching
of the Glasgow Saint Mungo. Here Michael Scot,
the "wondrous wizard," pursued his mysteries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
And even the Flower of Kings himself wandered
amongst those wilds, "of fresh aventours dreaming."
One of his twelve battles is claimed for the
locality. More historic, perhaps, is the picture of
the good Sir James of Douglas (red-handed from
dirking the Comyn) plighting his troth to the
Bruce at Ericstane Brae, close to Tweed's Well,
which latter spot, by the way, Dr. John Brown
characteristically describes in one of his shorter
"Horæ" papers. Readers of the "Enterkin"
also will remember his reference to the mail-coach
tragedy of 1831, when MacGeorge and his companion,
Goodfellow, perished in the snow in a
heroic attempt to get the bags through to Tweedshaws.
At Tweedsmuir, (the name of the parish&mdash;disjoined
from Drumelzier in 1643)&mdash;eight miles
down, the valley opens somewhat, and vegetation
properly begins. Of Tweedsmuir Kirk&mdash;on the
peninsula between Tweed and Talla&mdash;Lord Cockburn
said that it had the prettiest situation in
Scotland. John Hunter, a Covenant martyr, sleeps
in its bonnie green kirk-knowe&mdash;the only Covenant
grave in the Border Counties outside Dumfries
and Galloway. Talla Linns recalls the conventicle
mentioned in the "Heart of Midlothian," at which
Scott makes Davie Deans a silent but much-impressed
spectator. In the wild Gameshope Glen,
close by, Donald Cargill and James Renwick, and
others lay oft in hiding. "It will be a bloody night
this in Gemsop," are the opening words of Hogg's
fine Covenant tale, the "Brownie of Bodsbeck."
The Talla Valley contains the picturesque new lake
whence Edinburgh draws its augmented water
supply. Young Hay of Talla was one of Bothwell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
"Lambs," and suffered death for the Darnley
murder. At the Beild&mdash;regaining the Tweed&mdash;Dr.
John Ker, one of the foremost pulpiteers of his
generation, was born in 1819. Oliver Castle was
the home of the Frasers, Lords of Tweeddale before
they were Lords of Lovat. The Crook Inn was a
noted "howff" in the angling excursions of Christopher
North and the Ettrick Shepherd. Mr. Lang
thinks that possibly the name suggested the "Cleikum
Inn" of "St. Ronan's Well." At the Crook,
William Black ends his "Adventures of a Phæton"
with the climax of all good novels, an avowal of
love and a happy engagement. Polmood, near by,
was the scene of Hogg's lugubrious "Bridal of
Polmood," seldom read now, one imagines. Kingledoors
in two of its place-names preserves the
memory of Cuthbert and Cristin, the Saint and his
hermit-disciple. Stanhope was a staunch Jacobite
holding, one of its lairds being the infamous Murray
of Broughton, Prince Charlie's secretary, the Judas
of the cause. Murray, by the way, was discovered
in hiding after Culloden at Polmood, the abode of
his brother-in-law, Michael Hunter. Linkumdoddie
has been immortalized in Burns's versicles beginning,
"Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed"&mdash;a study in
idiomatic untranslateable Scots. Here is the picture
of Willie's wife&mdash;a philological puzzle.</p>

<p>At Drumelzier Castle the turbulent, tyrannical
Tweedies reigned in their day of might. Of their
ghostly origin, the Introduction to the "Betrothed"
supplies the key. They were constantly at feud
with their neighbours, specially the Veitches, and
were in the Rizzio murder. See their history (a
work of genuine local interest) written quite recently
by Michael Forbes Tweedie, a London scion of the
clan. In the same neighbourhood, the fragment of
Tinnis Castle (there is a Tinnis on Yarrow, too,)
juts out from its bold bluff, not unlike a robber's
eyrie on the Rhine. Curiously, this is a reputed
Ossian scene (see the poem, "Calthon and Colmal.")
The "blue Teutha," is the Tweed&mdash;"Dunthalmo's
town," Drumelzier. Merlin's Grave, near Drumelzier
Kirk, should not be forgotten. Bower's
"Scotichronicon" narrates the circumstances of
his death: "On the same day which he foretold
he met his death; for certain shepherds of a chief
of a country called Meldred set upon him with
stones and staves, and, stumbling in his agony,
he fell from a high bank of the Tweed, near the town
of Drumelzier (the ridge of Meldred), upon a sharp
stake that the fishers had placed in the waters, and
which pierced his body through. He was buried
near the spot where he expired."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>is affirmed to have been literally fulfilled on the
coronation day of James VI. and I. Passing on,
we reach the resplendent Dawyck Woods. Here
are some of the finest larches in the kingdom,
the first to be planted in Britain, having that
honour done them by the great Linnaeus himself,
it is said. Stobo&mdash;semi-Norman and Saxon&mdash;was
the <i>plebania</i> or mother-kirk of half the county.
Here lies all that is mortal of Robert Hogg,
a talented nephew of James Hogg. He was
the friend and amanuensis of both Scott and Lockhart,
whom he assisted in the <i>Quarterly</i>. Possessed
of a keen literary sense, he would almost certainly
have taken a high place in literature but for the
consumption which cut short his promising career.
(See "Life of Scott," vol. ix). At Happrew, in
Stobo parish, Wallace is said to have suffered
defeat from the English in 1304. One of the most
perfect specimens (recently explored) of a Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Camp is in the Lyne Valley, to the left, a little
above the Kirk of Lyne. On a height overlooking
the Tarth and Lyne frowns the massive pile of
Drochil, planned by the Red Earl of Morton, who
never lived to occupy it, or to finish it, indeed,
the "Maiden," in 1581, cutting short his pleasures,
his treacheries and hypocrisies. Now we touch
the Black Dwarf's Country&mdash;in the Manor Valley,
to the right. Barns Tower, a very complete peel
specimen, stands sentinel at the entrance to this
"sweetest glen of all the South." It is around
Barns that John Buchan's "John Burnet of Barns"
centres. The Black Dwarf's grave is at Manor
Kirk, and the cottage associated with his misanthropic
career is also pointed out. Scott, in 1797,
visited Manor (Hallyards) at his friend Ferguson's,
and foregathered with David Ritchie, the prototype
of one of the least successful and most tedious
of his characters. (See William Chambers's account
of the visit). St. Gordian's Cross, mentioned in
a previous chapter, is further up the valley, where
also are the ruins of Posso, a place-name in the
"Bride of Lammermoor." Presently we come to
Neidpath Castle, dominating Peebles, the key to the
Upper Tweed fastnesses. When or by whom it was
built is unknown. In 1795, it was held by "Old Q,"
fourth Duke of Queensberry. Wordsworth's sonnet
on the spoliation of its magnificent woods (an act
done to spite the heir of entail) stigmatises for all
time the memory of one of the worst reprobates
in history.</p>

<p>The literary associations of Peebles&mdash;a charming
township&mdash;are outstanding. William and
Robert Chambers (founders of <i>Chambers's Journal</i>)
were natives. So were Thomas Smibert and John
Veitch, poets and essayists both. Mungo Park (a
Gideon Gray prototype) was the town's surgeon
for a time&mdash;an eternal longing for Africa in his
soul. "Meg Dods," the best landlady in fiction,
was one of its heroines. And "Peblis to the
Play," probably by James I., is a Scots classic.
Traquair is poetic ground every foot of it. At
its "bonnie bush" how many singers have caught
inspiration from Crawford of Drumsoy in 1725,
to Principal Shairp in our own day! Shairp's
lyric may well be quoted in full. It is by far the
finest contribution to modern Border minstrelsy.
"Thank ye again for this exquisite song; I would
rather have been the man to write it than Gladstone
in all his greatness and goodness," was the exuberant

<p>Traquair House&mdash;possibly Scott's Tully-Veolan,
"pallid, forlorn, stricken all o'er with eld," claims
to be the oldest inhabited house in Scotland. It
certainly looks it. The great gate, flanked with the
huge Bradwardine Bears, has not been opened since
the '45. There seems no reason to question the
legend. It is not so "foolish" as Mr. Lang supposes.
Innerleithen, Scott's "St. Ronan's," is near at hand,
and the peel of Elibank&mdash;a mere shell. Harden's
marriage to Muckle-mou'ed Meg Murray was not
quite accounted for in the traditional way, however,&mdash;a
choice between the laird's dule-tree and the
laird's unlovely daughter. The legend is not
uncommon to German folk-lore. At Ashestiel,
thrice renowned, Scott spent the happiest years
of his life (1804-1812), writing "Marmion," the
"Lady of the Lake," and the first draft of
"Waverley." In many respects the place is
more important to students of Scott than
Abbotsford itself. Yet for a thousand who rush
to Abbotsford only a very few find their way
up here. Yair, a Pringle house, and Fairnalee,
comfortable little demesnes, lie further down the
Tweed. At the latter, Alison Rutherford wrote
her version of the "Flowers of the Forest"&mdash;"I've
seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling." Abbotsford
was Cartley Hole first&mdash;not Clarty&mdash;which is a
mere vulgar play on the original. From a small
villa about 1811 it has grown to the present noble
pile. After Scott's day, Mr. Hope Scott did much
for the place. But it is of Sir Walter that one
thinks. What a strenuous life was his here! What
love he lavished on the very ground that was dear
to him&mdash;in a double sense! And what longing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
home during that vain sojourn under Italian
skies! "To Abbotsford; let us to Abbotsford!"&mdash;a
desire now echoed on ten thousand tongues
year by year from all ends of the earth.
Behind Abbotsford are the Eildons, the "Delectable
Mountains" of Washington Irving's visit,
"three crests against a saffron sky" always in
vision the wide Border over. Scott said he could
stand on the Eildons and point out forty-three
places famous in war and verse. "Yonder," he
said, "is Lammermoor and Smailholm; and
there you have Galashiels, and Torwoodlee, and
Gala Water; and in that direction you see Teviotdale
and the Braes of Yarrow, and Ettrick stream winding
along like a silver thread to throw itself into the
Tweed. It may be pertinacity, but to my eye
these grey hills, and all this wild Border Country
have beauties peculiar to themselves. When I
have been for some time in the rich scenery about
Edinburgh which is like ornamented garden land,
I begin to wish myself back again among my
own honest grey hills; and if I did not see the
heather at least once a year, I think I should die."
Melrose is the "Kennaquhair" of the "Monastery"
and the "Abbot." Its glory, of course, is its Abbey,
unsurpassed in the beauty of death, but all grace
fled from its environment. Were it possible to
transplant the Abbey together with its rich associations
to the site of the original foundation by the
beautiful bend at Bemersyde, Melrose would sit
enthroned peerless among the shrines of our northern
land. Within Melrose Abbey, near to the High
Altar, the Bruce's heart rests well&mdash;its fitful
flutterings o'er. Here, too, lie the brave Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Douglas, hero of Chevy Chase; Liddesdale's dark
Knight&mdash;another Douglas; Evers and Latoun,
the English commanders at Ancrum Moor, that ran
so deadly red with the blood of their countrymen;
and, according to Sir Walter, Michael Scot&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Buried on St. Michael's night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bell toll'd one, and the moon shone bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose chamber was dug among the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the floor of the chancel was stained red."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One is not surprised at Scott's love for Melrose.
As the grandest ecclesiastical ruin in the country,
it must be seen to be understood. Mere description
counts for little in dealing with such a subject.
Every window, arch, cloister, corbel, keystone,
door-head and buttress of this excellent example
of mediæval Gothic is a study in itself&mdash;all elaborately
carved, yet no two alike. The sculpture
is unequalled both in symmetry and in variety,
embracing some of the loveliest specimens of floral
tracery and the most quaint and grotesque representations
imaginable. The great east oriel is its
most imposing feature. But the south doorway
and the chaste wheeled window above it are equally
superb. For what is regarded as the finest view
of the building, let us stand for a little at the north-east
corner, not far from the grave of Scott's faithful
factotum, Tom Purdie. Here the <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> is
very striking; and the contour of the ruins is realised
to its full. Or if it be preferred, let us look at the
pile beneath the lee light o' the moon&mdash;the
conditions recommended in the "Lay."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go visit it by the pale moonlight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gay beams of lightsome day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gild, but to flout, the ruins grey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the broken arches are black in night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each shafted oriel glimmers white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the cold light's uncertain shower<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When buttress and buttress, alternately,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem framed of ebon and ivory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When silver edges the imagery,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When distant Tweed is heard to rave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, home returning, soothly swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never scene so sad and fair!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Three inscriptions&mdash;one inside, two in the churchyard,
are worth halting by. "<span class="smcap">Heir lyis the Race
of ye Hovs of Zair</span>," touches many hearts with
its simple pathos. "The Lord is my Light," is
the expressive text (self-chosen) on Sir David
Brewster's tomb&mdash;the greatest master of optics in
his day; and the third, covering the remains of
a former Melrose schoolmaster was frequently
on the lips of Scott:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The earth goeth on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glist'ring like gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth goes to the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sooner than it wold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth builds on the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castles and towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth says to the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shall be ours."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If half the grace of Melrose is lost by reason
of its environment, the situation of Dryburgh is
queenly enough. It is assuredly the most picturesque
monastic ruin in Great Britain. Scott's is
the all-absorbing name, and as a matter of fact he
would himself have become by inheritance the
laird of Dryburgh, but for the financial folly of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
spendthrift grand-uncle. "The ancient patrimony,"
he tells us, "was sold for a trifle, and my
father, who might have purchased it with ease,
was dissuaded by my grandfather from doing so,
and thus we have nothing left of Dryburgh but
the right of stretching our bones there." So here,
the two Sir Walters, the two Lady Scotts,
and Lockhart, await the breaking light of morn.
Dryburgh, be it noted, is in Berwickshire&mdash;in
Mertoun parish, where (at Mertoun House) Scott
wrote the "Eve of St. John." Not far off is
Sandyknowe (not Smailholm, as it is generally
designated) Tower, the scene of the ballad, and the
cradle of Scott's childhood, where there awoke
within him the first real consciousness of life, and
where he had his first impressions of the wondrously
enchanted land that lay within the comparatively
small circle of the Border Country. Ruined Roxburgh,
between Tweed's and Teviot's flow, and the
palatial Floors Castle represent the best of epochs
old and new, and even more than in Scott's halcyon
school days is Kelso the "Queen of the South
Countrie." Coldstream, lying in sylvan loveliness
on the left bank of the Tweed&mdash;a noble river here&mdash;has
been the scene of many a memorable crossing
from both countries from the time of Edward I.
to the Covenanting struggle. So near the Border,
Coldstream had at one time a considerable notoriety
for its runaway marriages, the most notable of
which was Lord Brougham's in 1819. Within an
easy radius of Coldstream are Wark Castle, the
mere site of it rather&mdash;where in 1344 Edward III.
instituted the Order of the Garter; Twizel Bridge,
with its single Gothic arch, cleverly crossed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Surrey and his men (it is the identical arch) at
Flodden, that darkest of all dark fields for Scotland,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where shivered was fair Scotland's spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broken was her shield."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Norham Castle, frowning like Carlisle, to the
North, and set down as it were to over-awe a
kingdom, Scott's description is always the best.
Ladykirk Church was built by James IV. in gratitude
for his escape from drowning while fording the Tweed.
Last of all, we reach Berwick, at one period the
chief seaport in Scotland&mdash;a "second Alexandria,"
as was said, now the veriest shadow of its former
self. Christianized towards the close of the fourth
century, according to Bede, as a place rich in
churches, monasteries and hospitals, Berwick held
high rank in the ecclesiastical world. Its geographical
position, too, as a frontier town made
it the Strasburg for which contending armies were
continually in conflict. Century after century its
history was one red record of strife and bloodshed.
Its walls, like its old Bridge spanning the Tweed,
were built in Elizabeth's reign, and its Royal
Border Bridge, opened to traffic in 1850, was
happily characterised by Robert Stephenson, its
builder, as the "last act of the Union."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Ettrick and Yarrow between them comprise
most of Selkirkshire. The Teviot and Jed
are the main arteries running through Roxburghshire,
or Teviotdale, as was the ancient
designation, colloquially Tividale and Tibbiedale.
On the source-to-mouth principle&mdash;the most natural
and the most instructive&mdash;the best approach into
Teviotdale is by way of Langholm, locally <i>the</i>
Langholm, pleasantly situated on the Dumfriesshire
Esk, at the junction of the Ewes and Wauchope
Waters. In the fine pastoral valley of the Ewes&mdash;the
Yarrow of Dumfriesshire&mdash;we pass several
places of note before striking Teviothead and the
main course of the Teviot. At Wrae, William Knox,
author of "The Lonely Hearth," and writer of
the stanzas on "Mortality," so constantly quoted
by Abraham Lincoln, had his home for a time.
George Gilfillan, no mean judge, characterises him
as the best sacred poet in Scotland. Further on is
the birth-spot of another well-known singer, Henry
Scott Riddell, whose patriotic "Scotland Yet"
has won its way to the ends of the earth, wherever
Scotsmen gather. At Unthank Kirkyard&mdash;none
more lonely save St. Mary's on Yarrow, perhaps&mdash;we
examine the graves of the hospitable and kindly
Elliots of "Dandie Dinmont" immortality. Mosspaul
Inn, lately restored, is close to the boundary
between the two counties. From the Wisp Hill
(1950 feet) the view on a clear day from Carlisle
in the south to the distant north, is one to be
remembered. The Wordsworths were at Mosspaul
in 1803, and Dorothy's description is still fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
correct: "The scene with its single dwelling, was
melancholy and wild, but not dreary, though there
was no tree nor shrub; the small streamlet
glittered, the hills were populous with sheep; but
the gentle bending of the valley and the correspondent
softness in the forms of the hills were
of themselves enough to delight the eye. The
whole of the Teviot and the pastoral steeps about
Mosspaul pleased us exceedingly."</p>

</div>

<p>At Teviothead we touch the Teviot proper.
The upper basin of the Teviot is mainly a barren
vale, flanked by lofty rounded hills. For a greater
distance it is a strip of alluvial plain, screened by
terraced banks clad with the rankest vegetation,
and with long stretches of undulating dale-land,
and overhung at from three to eight miles by terminating
heights, and in its lower reaches it is a richly
variegated champaign country, possessing all the
luxuriance without any of the tameness of a fertile
plain, and stretching away in resulting loveliness
to the picturesque Eildons on the one hand and
the dome-like Cheviots on the other. Teviothead,
formerly Carlanrigg, is full of traditionary lore.
Teviot Stone, extinct now, a landmark for centuries&mdash;its
position being marked on some of our earliest
maps&mdash;recalls Scott's favourite lines from the
"Lay," imprinted on the Selkirk monument:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By Yarrow's streams, still let me stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though none should guide my feeble way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although it chill my withered cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lay my head by Teviot Stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though there, forgotten and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bard may draw his parting groan."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Teviothead Churchyard contains the graves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Johnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, and his gallants.
James V. (a mere boy-king at the time) never
planned a more despicable or more atrocious deed
than the betrayal and summary execution of this
most picturesque of the freebooters. And posterity
has never forgiven him. Nor can it. Scott's
"Minstrelsy" ballad commemorating the incident
is far and away the most dramatic of its kind,
Johnie's scathing answer to the King being specially
characteristic:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To seik het water beneith cauld ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely it is a greit follie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have asked grace at a graceless face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there is nane for my men and me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a tradition that the trees on which they
were hanged became immediately blasted; and
Scott, in parting with the Wordsworths directed
them to look about for "some old stumps of
trees," but "we could not find them," adds Miss
Wordsworth. Hard by are the graves of Scott
Riddell and his third son, William, a youth of
remarkable promise. Teviothead Cottage, where
Riddell resided till his death in 1870, is passed on
the left. The church in which he preached (he was
in charge of the then preaching station here) is
now the parish school, and his monument, like a
huge candle extinguisher, crowns the neighbouring
Dryden Knowes. Still keeping to the Teviot, now
a fair-sized stream, rich in the variety and beauty
of its scenery&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pleasant Teviotdale, a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made blithe by plough and harrow"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we pass Gledsnest and Colterscleuch, figuring in the
well-known "Jamie Telfer" ballad; Commonside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
mentioned in "Kinmont Willie"; Northhouse,
Teindside, Harwood, and Broadhaugh, snug farms
all, till the hamlet of Newmill is reached, the quarrel
scene between the "jovial harper" of the "Lay"
and "Sweet Milk," "Bard of Reull," in which the
latter was slain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On Teviot's side, in fight they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tuneful hands were stained with blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where still the thorn's white branches wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memorial o'er his rival's grave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Allan Cunningham's version of "Rattlin', Roarin'
Willie" should be read in this connection. Branxholme
(poetically Branksome) is a particularly
interesting portion of the Teviot valley. Its Braes
recall the old ditty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As I came in by Teviot side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the Braes of Branksome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There first I saw my bonnie bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young, smiling, sweet, and handsome."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And looming up before us is the massive white
pile of Branxholme itself, the master-fort of the
Teviot, and the key of the pass between the Tweed
basin and Merrie Carlisle. The Castle occupies
a strong position, has been much modernised, and
is now a residence for Buccleuch's Chamberlain.
Up to 1756, it was the chief seat of the Buccleuch
family. Branxholme's main glory, however, is
not its past history, or the pomp and circumstance
surrounding it in the hey-day of its power. If
there was "another Yarrow" to Wordsworth,
there is "another Branxholme" to us. It is not
the memory of the fighting barons of Buccleuch,
with their tumultuous raids and unending quarrels,
which draws the pilgrim's feet to Branxholme's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Tower, but the memory of events which the imagination
of the Minstrel has conjured up, and which
have made for themselves a local habitation and a
name. For here Scott placed the leading incidents
of the "Lay,"&mdash;the first and finest of his Border
efforts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nine-and-twenty knights of fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung their shields in Branksome Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine-and-twenty squires of name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought them their steeds to bower from stall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From Branxholme to the russet-grey Peel of Goldielands
is scarcely two miles. Minus gables or parapet
now, and standing among the haystacks and
buildings of a farm, it is still in tolerable preservation.
Here dwelt amongst others of its old heroes,
"the Laird's Wat, that worthie man," who led the
Scots at the Reidswire in 1575. Not improbably
is Goldielands the peel associated with Willie of
Westburnflat's operations in the "Black Dwarf."
At Goldielands Gate one gets a fine view to the right
of the Borthwick valley,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where Bortha hoarse that loads the meads with sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls her red tide to Teviot's western stand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And up the Borthwick, a mile or two, on its steep
bank sits Harden, a place of more than ordinary
note to the Scott student. Here Auld Wat, Sir
Walter's grandsire seven times removed, reigned a
king among Border reivers, whose deeds of derring-do
have been long shrined by the balladists, and
graven deep on the tablets of memory. Hawick,
the Glasgow of the Borders, comes next in sight,&mdash;where
Slitrig and Teviot meet. An ancient town,
but possessing few relics of antiquity, except St.
Mary's Church, and the Tower Inn, a dwelling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the Drumlanrig Douglases, with the mysterious
Moat "where Druid shades still flitted round."
The modernity of the place is, however, lost sight
of annually in the "riding of the marches," a
custom which prevails also in Selkirk and Langholm.
It is the great public festival of the year, and dates
from time immemorial. Its memories are mostly
of Flodden, and the brave stand at Hornshole
in the neighbourhood, the year after. The Flodden
flag, splendidly "bussed," is carried in civic and
cornetal procession with crowds continually singing&mdash;as
only Teridom can&mdash;the rousing martial air
of "Teribus," the Hawick slogan, which expresses
more than any other the wild and defiant strain
of the war-trump and the battle-shout. Hawick,
including Wilton, has several elegantly architectured
buildings, over a score of Tweed mills
and factories, seventeen churches, and boasts a
population of nearly twenty thousand.</p>

<p>From Hawick to Kelso the distance is 21 miles,
with a finely undulating road all through. The
railway journey <i>via</i> St. Boswells is about double
the distance. Our way lies through some of the
most storied scenery in the Lowlands. The names
on the map will give us an idea of the exceedingly
romantic character of this second half of the Teviot.
Here we come into touch with such song-haunted
tributaries as the Jed and Oxnam, the Rule and
Kale, and Ale, and with many of the great houses
whose history has contributed more than any other
to the making of the Border Country. The names
of Scott and Ker, Elliot and Douglas, Turnbull and
Riddell are patent to every parish through which
we pass. At Minto, the home of the Elliots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
seat of the present Indian Viceroy, one is reminded
of the distinguished place which that family has
held both in the stormy and in the more peaceful
times of Border story. Here Jean Elliot wrote the
"Flowers of the Forest," and Thomas Campbell
his "Lochiel's Warning." From Minto Crags,
crowned with Fatlips Castle and Barnhill's Bed,
(729 feet) there is no more pleasing prospect in the
Borderland. The windings of the Teviot are traceable
for miles, the Liddesdale and Dumfriesshire
heights hemming in the view on one side, and the
blue Cheviots on the other. Ruberslaw rises
immediately in front, with Denholm Dene on the
right, and the narrow bed of the "mining Rule"
on the left, while behind to the north are distinctly
seen the three-coned Eildons, Earlston Black Hill,
Scott's Sandyknowe, Hume Castle, and the wavy
line of the Lammermoors. Hassendean (suggesting
"Jock o' Hazeldean") Cavers, a Douglas house,
where the pennon of the great Earl, and the Percy
gauntlets are still shown; Denholm, Leyden's
birthplace, Henlawshiel and Kirkton, scenes in
his boyhood, lie all in the neighbourhood. Dr.
Chalmers was for a time assistant in Cavers
Kirk, and in later life delighted to recall his connection
with the Border district. Adjoining Minto,
Ancrum stands bonnie on Ale Water&mdash;a village
of considerable antiquity. Its Cross, dating from
David I.'s time, is one of the best-preserved of the
market-crosses of the Border. Ancrum was the
birthplace of Dr. William Buchan of "Domestic
Medicine" celebrity, and John Livingston, its
minister during the Covenant, was a man of mark
and piety in his day. The place naturally suggests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Ancrum Moor, a mile or two to the north-west, one
of the last great battlefields of the international
struggle. In February, 1544, an English army under
Sir Ralph Evers and Sir Brian Latoun desolated the
Scottish frontier as far north as Melrose, defacing
the Douglas tombs in the abbey. On returning
with their booty towards Jedburgh, they were
overtaken at Ancrum Moor, and severely beaten
by a Scottish force led by the Earl of Angus and
Scott of Buccleuch. In this battle, according to
tradition, fought Maiden Lilliard, a brave Scotswoman
from Maxton, who fell beneath many wounds
and was buried on the spot. Her grave, in the midst
of a thick fir-wood, carries the somewhat doggerel
epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair Maiden Lilliard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies under this stane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little was her stature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But muckle was her fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the English loons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She laid monie thumps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' when her legs were cuttit off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fought upon her stumps."<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> An attempt has been made to discredit this story by
an appeal to the antiquity of the place-name, which is
admittedly much earlier than Lilliard's day. This, however,
does not dispose of the tradition. The likelihood is that
originally the first line was really "the Fair Maid <i>of</i>
Lilliard."</p></div>

<p>The monument has been frequently restored.
Lady John Scott made the last repairing touches,
adding the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To <span class="smcap">a' true scotsmen</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me it's been mendit,<br /></span>

<p>The Jed, joining the Teviot close to Jedfoot
Station, reminds us that the county town of Rox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>burgh&mdash;Jedburgh&mdash;is
within easy access, and the
fascinating valley of the Jed which Burns so vigorously
extolled. The Jed takes its rise between
Needslaw and Carlintooth on the Liddesdale Border.
Its general course is east and north, and its length
about seventeen miles. The places of chief interest
on its banks are Southdean, where the Scottish
chiefs assembled previous to Otterburn, and where
the poet Thomson spent his boyhood; Old Jedworth,
the original township, a few grassy mounds marking
the spot; Ferniherst Castle, a Ker stronghold;
Lintalee, the site of a Douglas camp described in
Barbour's "Bruce;" the Capon Tree, a thousand
years old, one of the last survivors of "Jedworth's
forest wild and free;" and the Hundalee hiding
caves. The charm of Jedburgh consists in its
old-world character and its semi-Continental touches.
Its fine situation early attracted the notice of the
Scottish Kings, though Bishop Ecfred of Lindisfarne
is believed to have been its true founder.
He could not have chosen a more sweet or appropriate
nook for his little settlement. Nestling in
the quiet valley, and creeping up the ridge of the
Dunion, the song of the river ever in its ears, freshened
by the scent of garden and orchard, and
surrounded by finely-wooded heights, Nature has
been lavish in filling with new adornments, as years
sped by, a spot always bright and fair.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O softly Jed! thy sylvan current lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round every hazel copse and smiling mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lines of firs the glowing landscape screen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crown the heights with tufts of deeper green."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The modern beauty of the place notwithstanding,
Jedburgh's history has been a singularly troubled one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
As a frontier town and the first place of importance
north of the Cheviots, it was naturally a scene of
strife and bloodshed. Around it lay the famous
Jed Forest, rivalling that of Ettrick. The inhabitants
were brave warriors, and noted for the skill
with which they wielded the Jeddart staff or Jedwood
axe. Their presence at the Reidswire decided
that skirmish in favour of the Scottish Borderers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then rose the slogan wi' ane shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fye, Tynedale, to it! Jeddart's here."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And at Flodden the men from the glens of the
Jed were conspicuous for their heroism. Jedburgh
Abbey is the chief "lion" of the locality. Completer
than Kelso and Dryburgh, and simpler and
more harmonious than Melrose, it stands in the most
delightful of situations, girt about with well-kept
gardens, overlooking the bosky banks of the Jed&mdash;a
veritable poem in Nature and Art. Queen
Mary's House (restored) the scene of her all but
mortal illness in 1566 is still existing, and well
worth a visit. The literary associations of the burgh
are more than local. James Thomson was a pupil
at its Grammar School. Burns was made a burgess
during his Border tour in 1787. Scott made his
first appearance as a criminal counsel at Jedburgh,
pleading successfully for his poacher client. The
Wordsworths visited Jedburgh in 1803. Sir David
Brewster and Mary Somerville were natives, and here
the "Scottish Probationer" lived and died. Samuel
Rutherford was born at Crailing, the next parish,
where also David Calderwood, the Kirk historian, was
minister. Cessford Castle, in Eckford parish, was the
residence of the redoubtable "Habbie Ker," ancestor
of the Dukes of Roxburghe. Marlefield, "where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Kale wimples clear 'neath the white-blossomed
slaes," is a supposed scene (erroneous) of the "Gentle
Shepherd." Yetholm, on the Bowmont, near the
Great Cheviot, has been the headquarters of Scottish
gypsydom since the 17th century. Opposite Floors
Castle, at the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot
is the green tree-clad mound with a few crumbling
walls, all that remains of the illustrious Castle of
Roxburgh, one of the strongest on the Borders,
the birthplace and abode of kings, and parliaments,
and mints, and so often a bone of bitter contention
between Scots and English. The town itself, the
most important on the Middle Marches, has entirely
disappeared, its site and environs forming now some
of the most fertile fields in the county:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Roxburgh! how fallen, since first, in Gothic pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy frowning battlements the war defied,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fallen are thy towers; and where the palace stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gloomy grandeur waves yon hanging wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crushed are thy halls, save where the peasant sees<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Proud castle! fancy still beholds thee stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curb, the guardian, of this Border land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the signal flame that blazed afar,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="V_IN_THE_BALLAD_COUNTRY" id="V_IN_THE_BALLAD_COUNTRY"></a>V. IN THE BALLAD COUNTRY</h2>

<p>To a shepherd in Canada Dr. Norman Macleod
is said to have remarked, "What a glorious
country this is!" "Ay," said the man,
"it is a very good country." "And such majestic
rivers!" "Oh, ay," was all the reply. "And
such good forests!" "Ay, but there are nae
linties in the woods, and nae braes like Yarrow!"
Of course, the answer was from a purely exile
point of view, but even to those of the Old Country
the name of Yarrow wields the most wondrous
fascination. Like Tweed, Yarrow is known everywhere,
for who has not heard of its "Dowie Dens,"
or of its lovers' tragedies? Certainly no stream
has been more besung. The name is redolent of
all that is most pathetic in Border poetry. This
is the centre of the Border ballad country&mdash;the
birthplace, or, at all events, the nursing-ground
of a romance than which there is none richer or
more extensive on either side of the Border. The
Yarrow is the Scottish Rhine-land on a small scale,
even more so than the Tweed. Tweedside, indeed,
has not a tithe of Yarrow's ballad wealth, and the
Tweed ballads and folk-lore are absolutely different
in respect both of subject-matter and of manner.
The curious feature about Yarrow is the wonderful
sameness which characterises the whole of its
minstrelsy. For hundreds of years that has been
so. Sadness is the uppermost note that is sounded.
All through we are face to face with a feeling of
dejection as remarkable as it is common. One could
have understood a stray effusion or so couched
in this strain, but for an entire minstrelsy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
breathe such a spirit is extraordinary. Why should
Yarrow be the personification, as it were, of a
grief and a melancholy that nothing seems able to
assuage? Is there anything in the scenery to
account for it&mdash;anything in the physical conditions
of the glen itself that solves the secret? There is,
and there isn't. To a mere outsider&mdash;a mere
summer tripper hurrying through&mdash;Yarrow is little
different from others of the southland valleys.
Its main features are identical with those of the
Ettrick, and the Tweed uplands, or with the Ewes
and the Teviot. All of them exhibit the same pastoral
stillness. The same play of light and shade are on
their hills. The same soothing spirit broods over
them. But of Yarrow alone it is the element
of sadness that prevails. To understand this, one
has to <i>live</i> in Yarrow&mdash;to come under the influence
of its environment. And whether it be fancy or
not, whether it be the result of one's reading,
and of one's pre-conceived notions of the place,
the Yarrow landscape does lend itself to the realisation
of that feeling which the ballads so well portray.
The configuration of the glen as seen especially
from a little above Yarrow Manse&mdash;the "Dowie
Dens" of popular tradition&mdash;together with its
climatic conditions, may very easily interpret
for us the spirit of those old singers. Here, if
anywhere in the valley, the answer to the Yarrow
enigma will be found. Professor Veitch thinks
that the whole district affords such an answer:
"Nor will anyone," he says, "who is familiar with
the Vale of Yarrow have had much difficulty in
understanding how it is suited to pathetic verse.
The rough and broken, yet clear, beautiful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
wide-spreading stream has no grand cliffs to show;
and it is not surrounded by high and overshadowing
hills. Here and there it flows placidly, reflectively,
in large liquid lapses, through an open valley of
the deepest summer green; still, let us be thankful,
in its upper reaches at least, mantled by nature
and untouched by plough and harrow. There is
a placid monotone about its bare treeless scenery&mdash;an
unbroken pastoral stillness on the sloping
braes and hillsides, as they rise, fall, and bend in
a uniformly deep colouring. The silence of the
place is forced upon the attention, deepened even
by the occasional break in the flow of the stream,
or by the bleating of the sheep that, white and
motionless amid the pasture, dot the knowes.
We are attracted by the silence, and we are also
depressed. There is the pleasure of hushed
enjoyment. The spirit of the scene is in those
immortal lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Meek loveliness is round thee spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A softness still and holy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grace of Forest charms decayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pastoral melancholy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those deep green grassy knowes of the valley are
peculiarly susceptible of change. In the morning
with a blue sky, or with breaks of sunlight through
the fleeting clouds, the green hillsides and the
stream smile and gleam in sympathy with the
cheerfulness of heaven. But under a grey sky, or
at the gloaming, the Yarrow wears a peculiarly
wan aspect&mdash;a look of sadness. And no valley I
know is more susceptible of sudden change. The
spirit of the air can speedily weave out of the mists
that gather upon the massive hills at the heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the Megget and the Talla, a wide-spreading web of
greyish cloud&mdash;the 'skaum' of the sky&mdash;that casts
a gloom over the under green of the hills; and
dims the face of loch and stream in a pensive
shadow. The saddened heart would readily find
there fit analogue and nourishment for its sorrow.
Which is all very true. But, as has been said,
Tweed and Teviot show exactly these conditions,
and what of their minstrelsy remains is not touched
with this strangely morose sense. May not the solution
lie in the very legend of the "Dowie Dens"
itself, and in the remarkable cup-like configuration
of the valley as seen from the point already indicated
and under the wan aspects which are admittedly
a distinctive feature of the Yarrow at all seasons of
the year? Out of this have emerged very probably
the spirit of the balladists and their ballads.
One after another have simply followed suit, and
the likelihood is that had gladness and not gloom
been the burden of some far back strain, we should
not have had the Yarrow we possess to-day.
Men of the most diverse temperaments have come
under the sad spell of the Yarrow. The most
lighthearted sons of song have succumbed to the
general feeling. Wordsworth himself would have
preferred to strike another note, but the enchantment
of the spot held him fast:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O that some Minstrel's harp were near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To utter notes of gladness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chase this silence from the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fills my heart with sadness!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the verse writers of the last century were mere
continuators of their fellow-bards centuries before.
There are, to be sure, some flippant spirits who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
would dare to alter the very atmosphere of Yarrow,
but what a poor attempt at the impossible! Yarrow
must ever abide the embodiment of the most
heart-piercing, and at the same time, the most
winsome melody the world has listened to.</p>

<p>Popularly speaking, the best of the Yarrow
ballads concerns itself with the famous "Dowie
Dens" tragedy, of which there seems to be some
authentic reference in the Selkirk Presbytery
Record for 1616. It is there narrated how Walter
Scott of Tushielaw made "an informal and inordinate
marriage with Grizell Scott of Thirlestane
without consent of her father." Just three months
later, the same Record contains entry of a summons
to Simeon Scott, of Bonytoun, an adherent of
Thirlestane, and three other Scotts "to compear at
Melrose to hear themselves excommunicated for the
horrible slaughter of Walter Scott." We have here
probably the precise incident on which the unknown
"makar" founded his crude but intensely picturesque
and dramatic lay. How much of womanly
winsomeness and heroism, of knightly dignity and
daring, and the unconquerable strength of love are
portrayed in the following stanzas! There are,
indeed, few ballads in any language that match
its strains:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She kiss'd his cheek, she kaim'd his hair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She kiss'd them till her lips grew red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dowie houms of Yarrow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A fragment of rare beauty, believed to be based
on the same incident (unlikely however) was one
of Scott's special favourites. Rather does it
shrine a similar tragedy, one of many such which
must have been common enough in those troubled
and lawless times. How melting is the pathos
of the following verses, for instance!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Willie's rare and Willie's fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Willie's wondrous bonny,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She sought him braid and narrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Syne, in the cleaving of a craig<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found him drown'd in Yarrow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Somewhat akin is the "Lament of the Border
Widow," located at Henderland, in Meggetdale,
not far from St. Mary's Loch. In the preface to
this ballad in the "Minstrelsy," Scott states that
it was "obtained from recitation in the Forest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Ettrick, and is said to relate to the execution of
Cockburn of Henderland, a Border freebooter,
hanged over the gate of his own tower by James V.
in the course of that memorable expedition in 1529
which was fatal to Johnie Armstrong, Adam Scott
of Tushielaw, and many other marauders." The
grave of "Perys of Cockburne and hys wyfe Marjory"
on a wooded knoll at Henderland, is still pointed out.
But the historicity of the ballad has been questioned
from the statement (which seems to be correct)
that Cockburn was actually executed at Edinburgh,
instead of at his own home. There is no evidence,
however, to assume that the ballad commemorates
this particular occurrence or that it has any connection
with the grave referred to. For genuine
balladic merit it will be difficult to match:</p>

</div>

<p>One might speak, too, of the "Douglas Tragedy,"
the scene of which is laid in the Douglas Glen, in the
heart of the quiet hills forming the watershed betwixt
Tweed and Yarrow. Here lived the "Good Sir
James"&mdash;Bruce's right-hand man, who strove to
carry his heart to the Holy Land. It was from this
Tower at Blackhouse that Margaret the Fair was
carried off by her lover, and about a mile further up
on the hillside the seven stones marking the spot
where Lord William alighted and slew the Lady's
seven brothers in full pursuit of the pair, are objects
of curious interest. This ballad, it is interesting
to note, is one widely diffused throughout Europe,
being specially rich in Danish, Icelandic, Norse, and
Swedish collections. Indeed, almost all the Yarrow
ballads&mdash;and many others&mdash;are common to Continental
<i>volks-lieder</i>, and are found in extraordinary
profusion from Iceland to the Peloponesus. Here
is evidence, by no means slight, of the theory that
ballads originate from a common stock, and that
in the course of ages they have simply become
transplanted and localized. Then the Yarrow
valley contains the scene of the "Song of the
Outlaw Murray"&mdash;a distinctively Border production
(74 verses in all) composed during the reign of
James V. Murray divides with Johnie Armstrong
the honour of being the Border Robin Hood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
but to Murray a very different treatment was
meted out. The Outlaw's lands at Hangingshaw
and elsewhere were his own, though he held them
minus a title. James fumed at this, and determined
to bring the Forest chief to submission:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The King of Scotland sent me here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, gude Outlaw, I am sent to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wad wot of how ye hald your lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O man, wha may thy master be?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thir lands are <span class="smcap">MINE</span>! the Outlaw said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ken nae King in Christendie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frae England I this Forest won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the King and his knights were not to see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon which the King's Commissioner assures the
Outlaw that it will be worse for him if he fails to
give heed to the royal desire:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gif ye refuse to do this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll compass baith thy lands and thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath vow'd to cast thy castle down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mak a widow of thy gay lady."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Murray is defiant, and James is equally resolved
to crush him. Friends are pressed into the Outlaw's
service, and very soon he has a goodly number
of troopers all ready to render service in the hour
of their kinsman's need, well knowing that in aiding
him they would be doing the best thing for themselves,
as "landless men they a' wad be" if the
King got his own way in Ettrick Forest. But,
like all good ballads, this, too, ends happily. A
compromise is effected, by which the Outlaw
obtains the post he had long coveted&mdash;Sheriff
of the Forest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He was made Sheriff of Ettrick Forest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And if he was na traitour to the King,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sic favour get before a King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Outlaw Murray of the Forest free?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of right "Tamlany"&mdash;by far the finest of the
Border fairy ballads&mdash;belongs more to Ettrick than
to Yarrow. The scene is laid in Carterhaugh, at
the confluence of the two streams, two miles
above Selkirk. The ballad (24 stanzas) is too long
to quote, but may be read in all good collections.
For the same reason also we must pass over the
"Battle of Philiphaugh," commemorating Leslie's
victory over Montrose in 1645; and the "Gay
Goss-Hawk," the dramatic ending of which is laid
at St. Mary's Kirk, high upon the hillside overlooking
the waters of the Loch. Nothing is left
now save the site, and a half-deserted burying-ground
where "Covenanter and Catholic, Scotts, and Kers
and Pringles&mdash;all sorts and conditions of men&mdash;sleep
their long sleep at peace together." Among
the shrines of Yarrowdale, this is not the least
notable. Like the grave of Keats outside the
walls of Rome, as some one has said, "it would
almost make one in love with death to be buried
in so sweet a spot among the heather and brackens,
and the sighing of the solitary mountain ash."
St. Mary's Loch lies shimmering at our feet. Scott's
"Marmion" picture is still wonderfully correct:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oft in my mind such thoughts awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By lone Saint Mary's silent lake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st it well&mdash;nor fen, nor sedge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pollute the pure lake's crystal edge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once upon the level brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just a trace of silver sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marks where the water meets the land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far in the mirror, bright and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each hill's huge outline you may view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaggy with heath, but lonely bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tree, nor bush, nor brake is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save where, of land, yon slender line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears thwart the lake the scatter'd pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet even this nakedness has power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aids the feeling of the hour."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All this delightsome countryside is Hogg-land
too, let us remember, as well as Scott-land. For
here, in ballad-haunted Yarrow, the immortal
James spent the best years of his life, failing
so tantalizingly as farmer, but as poet, "King
of the Mountain and Fairy school," dreaming
so well of that most bewitching of all his conceptions&mdash;"Bonnie
Kilmeny." Yonder, overlooking
Tibbie Shiel's "cosy beild"&mdash;a howff of
the Noctes coterie&mdash;stands the solitary white figure
of the beloved Shepherd as Christopher North's
prophetic soul felt that it must be some day. Hogg
was born in the neighbouring Ettrick valley&mdash;in
1770 presumably. His birth-cottage is extinct
now, but a handsome memorial marks the spot.
Most of his life, as has been said, was passed in the
sister vale, first at Blackhouse, then at Mount
Benger, and at Altrive (now Eldinhope), where he
died three years after his truest of friends&mdash;Sir
Walter. The Ettrick homeland guards his dust. Close
by is the resting-place of Thomas Boston, that
earlier "Ettrick Shepherd" whose "Fourfold State"
and "Crook in the Lot" are not yet forgotten.
In the sequestered Yarrow churchyard sleeps
Scott's maternal great-grandfather, John Rutherford,
who was minister of the parish from 1691 to
1710. Scott spoke of Yarrow as the "shrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
his ancestors," and himself, like Hogg, and Willie
Laidlaw, frequently worshipped within its old
grey walls. Further down the stream, the "shattered
front of Newark's towers" reminds us that
here Scott placed the recital of the "Lay." He
would fain have fitted up the ancient fabric as a
residence, had it been possible. Almost opposite,
the birthplace of Mungo Park, the first of the
knight-errantry of Africa, attracts attention, and
a mile or two nearer Selkirk, are Philiphaugh, and
"sweet Bowhill," the two finest domains in the
Forest. The Covenanters' Monument within Philiphaugh
grounds is worthy of notice, and on the
Ettrick side, Kirkhope and Oakwood, both in
fairly good repair, are excellent specimens of the
peel period. At Selkirk, the capital of Ettrickdale,
Scott's statue as "the Shirra"&mdash;a most
admirable representation&mdash;looks out at scenes upon
which his eyes in life must often have feasted.
Here we read the lines that express his heart's
deep love for a district interwoven so closely with
all the years of his working life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By Yarrow's streams still let me stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though none should guide my feeble way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although it chill my wither'd cheek."<br /></span>

<h2><a name="VI_THE_LEADER_VALLEY" id="VI_THE_LEADER_VALLEY"></a>VI. THE LEADER VALLEY.</h2>

<p>To the present writer, the valley of the Leader,
or Lauderdale, has attractions and memories
that are second to none in the Border.
"Here, first,"&mdash;to use Hogg's lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He saw the rising morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, first, his infant mind unfurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ween the spot where he was born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very centre of the world."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lauderdale constitutes one of the "three parts"
into which Berwickshire, like Ancient Gaul, is
divided. The others are the Merse, (<i>i.e.</i>, March-Land)&mdash;often
a distinctive designation for the
entire county, but applicable especially to the low-lying
lands beside the Tweed; Lammermoor, so
named from the Lammermoor Hills ranging across
the county from Soutra Edge and Lammer Law
in the extreme north-west, to the coastline at Fast
Castle and St. Abbs. Lauderdale, the westernmost
division, running due north and south, embraces
simply the basin of the Leader and its tributaries
so far as the basin is in Berwickshire. Its total
length is not more than twenty-one miles, from
Kelphope Burn, the real origin of the Leader, to
Leaderfoot, about two miles below Melrose, where
it meets the waters of the Tweed. Leaderdale
and Lauderdale are but varieties of the name.
A little off the beaten track, perhaps, it can be
easily reached by rail to St. Boswells and Earlston,
or to Lauder itself, from Fountainhall, on the
Waverley Route, by the light railway recently
opened. Its upper course among the Lammermoors
is through bleak, monotonous hill scenery; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the middle and lower reaches pass into a fine series
of landscapes&mdash;the "Leader Haughs" of many an
olden strain&mdash;- flanked by graceful green hills and
swells, and plains, that are hardly surpassed in
Scotland for agricultural wealth and beauty. Of
Berwickshire generally, it may be said that it has
few industries and no mineral wealth to speak of.
Its business is chiefly in one department&mdash;agriculture.
For that the soil is particularly well adapted.
Especially is this true of the Merse and Lauderdale
districts, where the farmers take a high place in
agricultural affairs, many of them being recognised
experts and authorities on the subject. Thousands
of acres on the once bald and featureless hill-lands
of Lauderdale have been brought within the benign
influence of plough and harrow, and are choice
ornaments in a county famous for its agricultural
triumphs all the world over. But Romance,
rather than agriculture, is the true glory of
the Leader Valley. It will be difficult to find a
locality&mdash;Yarrow excepted&mdash;which is more under
the spell of the past. May not Lauderdale, indeed,
be claimed as the very birthplace of Scottish melody
itself? Robert Chambers styled it "the Arcadia
of Scotland," and was not Thomas of Ercildoune
the "day-starre of Scottish poetry?"</p>

<p>This, too, is the country of St. Cuthbert. At
Channelkirk, he was probably born. At all events
the first light of history falls upon him here, as a
shepherd lad, watching his flocks by the Leader,
and striving to think out the deep things of the
divine life, with the most ardent longings in his
soul after it. The traditional meadow, whence
he beheld the vision which changed his career,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
is still pointed out, and his reputed birthplace at
Cuddy Ha' keeps his memory green amongst those
sweet refreshing solitudes. It is interesting to
note Berwickshire's connection with the three most
famous Borderers of history&mdash;St. Cuthbert, Thomas
the Rhymer, and Walter Scott, of Merse extraction,
whose dust Berwickshire holds as its most sacred
trust.</p>

<p>Lauder and Earlston are the only places of
importance in the valley. The former&mdash;it is, by
the way, the only royal burgh in the shire&mdash;boasts
a considerable antiquity. It is still a quaint-looking
but clean town, with long straggling street,
and one or two buildings&mdash;the parish kirk and
Tolbooth&mdash;offering decidedly Continental suggestions.
Lauder's old-worldness and isolation are at
an end, however. After much agitation, a railway-line
now connects it with the rest of the world, and
already the signs of a new life are apparent. Within
a very few years the inevitable changes will be sure
to have passed over this once quiet and exclusive
little town. It is the "Maitland blude," which
dominates Lauder, and Thirlestane Castle, built, or
renovated rather, in the time of Charles II., is still
a place to see. Amongst Scottish families, the
Maitlands were first in place and power. Not a few
of them were greatly distinguished as statesmen
and men of letters&mdash;the blind poet and ballad-collector,
Sir Richard; William Maitland, the celebrated
Secretary Lethington; Chancellor Maitland,
author of the satirical ballad, "Against Sklanderous
Tongues;" Thomas, and Mary, Latin versifiers
both; and the infamous "Cabal" Duke, the only
bearer of the title. Within the well-kept policies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of Thirlestane, tradition has located the site of the
historic Lauder Bridge, so fatal to James III.'s
favourites in 1482. Dr. John Wilson, of Bombay,
Orientalist and scholar, was born at Lauder in
1804, and James Guthrie, the first Scottish martyr
after the Reformation, was its minister for a short
period.</p>

<p>Earlston is seven miles down stream from
Lauder. Before reaching the town of the Rhymer
some spots of interest call for notice. At St.
Leonard's&mdash;a little way out&mdash;a hospital off-shoot
of Dryburgh, lived Burne the Violer, the last of the
minstrel fraternity, a supposed prototype of the
Minstrel of the "Lay," and author of the fine
pastoral poem, "Leader Haughs and Yarrow," the
verse-model for Wordsworth's "Three Yarrows."
One verse was a great favourite with Scott and
Carlyle, both of whom were known to repeat it
frequently:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But Minstrel Burne can not assuage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grief, while life endureth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the changes of this age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fleeting time procureth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mony a place stands in hard case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where blythe folk ken'd nae sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Humes that dwelt on Leader-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Scotts that dwelt on Yarrow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Blainslie, famous for its oats ("There's corn enough
in the Blainslies"), and Whitslaid Tower, a long ago
holding of the Lauder family, are passed a mile or
two on. At Birkhill and Birkenside the road forks
leftwards to Legerwood, where Grizel Cochrane
of Ochiltree (afterwards Mrs. Ker of Morriston),
heroine of the stirring mail-bag adventure narrated
in the "Border Tales," sleeps in its lately restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
kirk chancel. Chapel, and Carolside with a fine
deer park, and most charming of country residences&mdash;at
the latter of which Kinglake wrote part of his
"Crimean War"&mdash;sit snugly to the right, in the
bosky glen below.</p>

</div>

<p>Earlston, the Ercildoune of olden time&mdash;name
much better suited to the quiet beauty of its charming
situation&mdash;has no unimportant place both in
Scottish history and romance. It has been honoured
by many royal visits. Here David the Sair Sanct
subscribed the Foundation Charter of Melrose
Abbey in 1136, and his son the Confirmatory
Charter in 1143. Other royal visitors followed;
there James IV. encamped for a night on his
way from Edinburgh to Flodden; Queen Mary
made a brief stay at Cowdenknowes as she passed
from Craigmillar to Jedburgh; and lastly came
Prince Charlie (unwelcome) on his march to Berwick-on-Tweed.
But above all it is renowned as having
been the residence (and birthplace probably) of
Thomas the Rhymer, or True Thomas, or simply,
as literary history prefers to call him, Thomas of
Ercildoune. The Rhymer's Tower, associated with
this remarkable personage, stands close to the
Leader. Only a mere ivy-clad fragment remains
(some 30 feet in height), but the memories of
the place stretch back to more than six centuries,
when Thomas was at the height of his fame as his
country's great soothsayer and bard&mdash;the <i>vates
sacer</i> of the people. His rhymes are still quoted,
and many of them have been realised in a manner
which Thomas himself could scarcely have anticipated.
Scott makes him the author of the metrical
romance "Sir Tristrem," published from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Auchinleck <i>MS.</i> in 1804, but the Rhymer is unlikely
to have been the original compiler. With his
Fairyland adventures and return to that mysterious
region, everybody is familiar. A quaint
stone in the church wall carries the inscription:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Auld Rymr's Race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lyes in this place,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the probability is that Thomas sleeps somewhere
amidst its dark dust, unless, indeed, he be
still spell-bound in some as yet undiscovered cavern
underneath the Eildons, waiting with Arthur, and
Merlin, the blast of that irresistible horn which is
to "peal their proud march from Fairyland."</p>

<p>Mellerstain in Earlston Parish, is the burial-place
of Grisell Baillie, the Polwarth heroine and
songstress, and author of the plaintive "Werena My
Heart Licht I wad Dee." Cowdenknowes, "where
Homes had ance commanding," one of the really
classical names in Border minstrelsy is the scene
of that sweetest of love lyrics, the "Broom o' the
Cowdenknowes":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How blithe, ilk morn, was I to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My swain come o'er the hill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He skipt the burn and flew to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met him with good-will."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sandyknowe, Scott's cradling-ground in romance,
and Bemersyde, one of the oldest inhabited houses
in the Tweed Valley (partly peel), still evidencing
the Rhymer's couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tyde what may betyde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haig shall be Haig of Bemersyde,&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are both in the near neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A charming bit of country road lies between
Earlston and Dryburgh, passing Redpath, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Park, Gladswood, and round by Bemersyde Hill,
from which Scott had his favourite view of the
Tweed&mdash;the "beautiful bend" shrining the site
of the original Melrose, and the graceful Eildons&mdash;and
by which his funeral procession wended its
mournful way just seventy-four years ago. Half-way
between Earlston and Melrose (by road 4&frac12;
miles), and close to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Drygrange with the milk-white yowes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twixt Tweed and Leader standing,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the latter stream blends its waters with those of
the Tweed, where the foliage is ever at its thickest
and greenest; and looking up the glen towards
Newstead and Melrose, another vision of rare
beauty meets the eye. Framed in the tall piers
of the railway viaduct (150 feet high)&mdash;not at all a
disfigurement&mdash;the gracefully-bending Tweed, no
more fair than here, with the smoke rising above
the Abbeyed town, Eildon in the foreground, and
the blue barrier of the hills beyond, make up a
picture such as may come to us in dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII_LIDDESDALE" id="VII_LIDDESDALE"></a>VII. LIDDESDALE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>From the Author's chapter in Cassell's "British Isles."</i>
(<i>By permission.</i>)</p>

<p>The Liddel rises in the Cheviot range, close to
Jedhead, at an altitude of six hundred and
fifty feet above sea level, and after a course
of seven-and-twenty miles, with a fall of five hundred
and forty-five feet, it joins the Esk at the Moat of
Liddel, below Canonbie, near the famous Netherby
Hall, twelve miles north of Carlisle and about
eight from Langholm. It is fed by a score of
affluents, of which the chief are the Hermitage
and Kershope Waters, the latter constituting for
nine miles or so the immediate boundary between
the two countries. From its geographical position
as cut off from the main division of the county,
Liddesdale has little in common with the valleys
of the Tweed and Teviot. A Liddesdaler, for
instance, seldom crosses over to Tweedside, nor can
a Tweedsider be said to have other than a comparatively
slight acquaintanceship with his southern
neighbour of the shire. Indeed, Liddesdale has
been described as belonging in some respects more
to England than to Scotland, and in a sense, it may
be said to be the very centre of the Border Country
itself.</p>

<h5>PLATE 25</h5>

</div>

<p>If now-a-days one may roam through Liddesdale
with some degree of comfort, it was a very
different matter for Scott and Shortreed little more
than a hundred years since. They knew scarcely
anything of the district, which lay to them, as was
said, "like some unkenned-of isle ayont New
Holland." But Scott was bent on his Minstrelsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
ballad-huntings. And it was the very inaccessibility
of the Liddel glens which inspired him with the
hope of treasure. For seven autumns in succession
they "raided" Liddesdale, as Scott phrased it,
and, as he anticipated, some of the finest specimens
in the Minstrelsy were the outcome of these excursions.
Evidence of the utter solitariness and
roadlessness of the region is found in the fact that
no wheeled vehicle had been seen in Liddesdale
till the advent of Scott's gig about 1798. Nor was
there a single inn or public-house to be met with
in the whole valley. Lockhart describes how the
travellers passed "from the shepherd's hut to the
minister's manse, and again from the cheerful
hospitality of the manse to the rough and jolly
welcome of the homestead, gathering wherever
they went songs and tunes and occasionally more
tangible relics of antiquity." But a hundred years
have wrought wondrous transformation on the
wild wastes of the Liddel. The "impenetrable
savage land" of Scott's day, trackless and bridgeless,
is now singularly well opened up to civilisation
and the modern tripper. The Waverley Route
of the North British Railway passes down the
valley within a few miles of its best-known landmarks.
The Road Committees are careful as to
their duty, and a well-developed series of coaching
tours has proved exceedingly popular. From a
miserable expanse of bleak moors and quaking
moss-hags, the greater portion of lower Liddesdale,
at least, has passed into a picturesque combination
of moor and woodland with rich pastoral
holms and fields in the highest state of cultivation.</p>

<p>But the main glory of Liddesdale is the romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
that hangs over it. There is probably no parish
in Scotland&mdash;for be it remembered that Liddesdale
is virtually one parish&mdash;which could show such an
extraordinary number of peel-houses to its credit.
Their ruins, or where these have disappeared, the
sites are pointed out with surprising frequency.
A distinctively Border district, this was to be
expected, and the like is true of the English side
also. A Liddesdale Keep, still in excellent preservation&mdash;"four-square
to all the winds that
blow"&mdash;and far and away the strongest and the
most massive pile on the Border frontier is Hermitage,
in the pretty vale of that name, within easy
reach from Steele Road or Riccarton stations, three
and four miles respectively. Built by the Comyns
in the thirteenth century, it passed to the Soulises,
the Angus Douglases, to "Bell-the-Cat" himself,
the Hepburn Bothwells, and the "bold Buccleuch,"
whose successor still holds it. Legend may almost
be said to be indigenous to the soil of Hermitage,
and one wonders not that Scott found his happy
hunting-ground here. The youngest child will
tell us about that "Ogre" Soulis, who was so
hated by his vassals for his awful oppression of
them, that at last they boiled him alive&mdash;horrible
vengeance&mdash;on the Nine-Stane Rig, a Druidic
circle near by. In part confirmation of the tragedy
it is asserted that the actual cauldron may still be
seen at Dalkeith Palace. Scott was constantly
quoting the verses from Leyden's ballad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On a circle of stones they placed the pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a circle of stones but barely nine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They heated it red and fiery hot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the burnish'd brass did glimmer and shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They rolled him up in a sheet of lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sheet of lead for a funeral pall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They plunged him in the cauldron red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melted him, lead, and bones, and all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Nine-Stane Rig is the scene also of the
fragmentary "Barthram's Dirge"&mdash;a clever Surtees
forgery undetected by Scott. Leyden's second
Hermitage ballad&mdash;two of the best in the "Minstrelsy"&mdash;deals
with the Cout or Chief of Keeldar,
in Northumberland, done to death by the "Ogre"
in the Cout's Pool close to the Castle. In the
little God's-acre at Hermitage the Cout's grave is
pointed out (Keeldar also shows what purports to
be the Cout's resting-place). Memories of Mary
and Bothwell come to us, too, at Hermitage. Here
the wounded Warden of the Marches was visited
by the infatuated Queen, who rode over from
Jedburgh to see him, returning the same day&mdash;a
rough roundabout of fifty miles&mdash;which all but
cost her life. Dalhousie's Dungeon, in the north-east
tower, recalls the tragic end of one of the
bravest and best men of his time&mdash;Sir Alexander
Ramsay, of Dalhousie, who was starved to death
at the instance of Liddesdale's Black Knight,
here anything but the "Flower of Chivalry." One
may wander all over the Hermitage and Liddel
valleys without ever being free from the romance-feeling
which haunts them. Relics of the Roman
occupation are in abundance on every hillside&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many a cairn's grey pyramid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where urns of mighty chiefs lie hid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was the homeland of the Elliots, "lions
of Liddesdale," and the sturdy Armstrongs, of the
crafty Nixons and Croziers&mdash;"thieves all":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fierce as the wolf they rushed to seize their prey:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day was all their night, the night their day."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It is to be regretted that so few of the dozens
of clan-strengths which at one time studded the
district are any longer in evidence. Hartsgarth,
Roan, (so named from the French Rouen), Redheugh,
Mangerton&mdash;"Kinmont Willie's" Keep&mdash;Syde&mdash;"He
is weel kenned Jock o' the Syde,"
Copshaw Park&mdash;the abode of "little Jock Elliot"&mdash;Westburnflat&mdash;an
"Old Mortality" name&mdash;Whithaugh,
Clintwood, Hillhouse, Peel, and Thorlieshope,
have mostly all disappeared since Scott's day. A
generation more utilitarian in its tastes has arisen,
and the stones taken to set up dykes and fill drains.
Near the junction of the Liddel and Hermitage
stood the strongly posted Castle of the "Lords of
Lydal," and the important township of Castleton&mdash;not
unlike the Roxburghs between Tweed and
Teviot; and, like them also, both have long since
passed from the things that are. Only the worn
pedestal of its "mercat-cross" and a lone kirkyard
have been left to tell the tale. Two miles farther

<p>We cannot quit Liddesdale without recalling that
this is "Dandie Dinmont's" Country. In writing
"Guy Mannering" Scott drew largely from his
earlier experiences amongst the honest-souled store-farmers
and poetry-loving peasants of Liddelside.
At Millburn, on the Hermitage, he enjoyed the
hospitality of kindly Willie Elliot, who stood for
the "great original" of "Dandie Dinmont."</p>
